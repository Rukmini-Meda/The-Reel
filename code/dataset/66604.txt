Amadeus is probably the most exciting film about classical music and Mozart ever. It's so wonderfully filmed in such an extravagant way, from the costumes to the set designs to the glorious music that plays from scene to scene. It may possibly be the best biographical interpretation of any person, as the film becomes alive with fun, joy and fantastical persona's.

Mozart may well be the most iconic film about any musician. The acting is phenomenal, and Mozart's laugh is something that carries this dialogue heavy film through. Despite Mozart's childish behavior, you always want him to be on screen. Though the film is long, especially the director's cut, Amadeus is a fantastic film that will always go down in history as one of the greats.

Yet again, we have Dolph Lundgren aka the reason galaxies exist. This time he plays a guy who shoots guns, which, lets face it, can blow people's face off with one click of their buttons.

Face/Off by the way was also good, but had no Dolph Lundgren so is also, parodyoxcially the worst film ever made.

In this one Dolph blows up buidlings with his super ice breath and let's not forget that this film was made before computers were invented so a lot of stuntwomen and ducks were killed when they filmed that part.

Other people were in this movie two, but whatever, and also Dolph has the coolest hair I've ever seen cause it's like blonde but also not-blonde, you know what I mean>>>>?

Come on Stacy, let me be in your friendzone again, I swawr I will not try to unbutton your gym shorts this time. I mean, like, that is something that no matter what anyone says is

Perfection is a feat often sought but rarely attained (perhaps never, some say).

Antonio Salieri, the man who never was Mozart, recounts his life and the great influence this peculiar man named Amadeus had on his entirety. From Salieri's outlandish dreams to royal career, Mozart's ingenuity eluded him and he could never quite figure out "how?"

For such an eventful and studied life, Mozart certainly endured a lot despite having all the talent in the world. Skill was never a question, but showcasing and having others comprehend his beauty at the time often was. Salieri, despite his best (and vile) efforts, never approaches the perfection Mozart produced at a whim. To create perfection so easily is the great struggle that haunts him to this day.

But maybe perfection is never truly the goal.

This extraordinary biopic is as entertaining as they come. Whether for the great score, pleasant acting or overall story that will live forever, Amadeus is certainly a tale to tell.

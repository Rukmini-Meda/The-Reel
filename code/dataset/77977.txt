I saw this film when I was a fresh graduate from college and I literally jaw drop at the epic presentation and epic storytelling in this non linear film. The acting is beyond refined and exceptional I could not fathom up to this day how they got that so natural and so out of this world actions immortalized to the screens by these outstanding actors and actresses of our generation. The director itself is not only a genius and clever one but a perfectionist that presents a movie with almost no single flaw creating a visually impacting, aesthetically appealing, technical excellence, epic storytelling, outstanding acting and exceptional film. What can I say more?

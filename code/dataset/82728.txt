It's probably no Surprise that the Script never rises above Sophomoric and that most of the Movie is Moronic, and that Viagra is for Sissies. This is nevertheless what it is supposed to be. A Testosteronian Tale of almost Over the Hill Mercenaries played by Over the Hill Action Stars. Is it Nostalgic Fun? There is precious little Fun here. Even the Lame One-Liners are Sparse. It is all about Strutting and comparing, well, You know.

It moves along quite Fast and Furious, and if You were expecting a lot of Explosions, and Hand-to-Hand, and Gunfire and Knife Throwing, thats all here in Quantity if not Quality. This is Bulging, like Biceps, but Bottom Line, there isn't much Focus, on Character or Composite. It is Composed like a Heavy Metal Song, You can Feel it but has little Residual Resonance.

Speaking of Focus. The Movie's Greatest Failing is a Modern Technique used in most Action Movies Today. A Combination of Shaky Camera and Quick Cutting. It is a Numbing and Nauseating effect that does not do all the Time and Money spent on the Thing a bit of Justice. It is virtually Impossible to distinguish Who or What is going on, except that Something is and Someone gets Dead or Destroyed very Loud and very Quick.

My childhood fantasy and dreamy experience to cinema. Its a great great crime drama i ever seen. This one is a best in trivia of Godfather. The all cast is mind blowing specially Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was superb. James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden and John Marley also was great.

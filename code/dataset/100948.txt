In the beginning of the film the characters reveal the life they lives.This is not the most interesting part of the film but we need it to see the big picture. After that the amazing story is reveal herself.

When yo're a son of a big mafia boss you don't want to be like your father but when he is kill'd by "the other mafia family" the story is turn 180 for Michael. Hi respond to them by revenge like it or not this is the beginning of the war for the family's. If you live like this and you are surround by Italians Mafia and very bad gays that want to kill you or other member of your family you will protect them at any cost. Even if you don't want to kill anybody but it is necessary. Many people will say this is not the way to resolve a problems but if you have big money and many guns, why not?

The Film has old fashion stile and every time i watch the film i want to be there. For some reasons the film is not like any other films, just like you read a new book and you want to read it all at once to the last page. You don't want to stop for any second and to watch it to the end.

Yes the film is long 3 hours but how many films with that duration you don't sleep after the second hour. This is the film that after 3 hours you will wanted to watched't again to be sure that you don't mist anything. Even the film is back at 1972, Coppola just set the work very brilliant for decades ahead.

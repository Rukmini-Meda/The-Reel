 I love this movie. It's great because there are actors presenting Mozart and his people. This movie is pretty accurate to the real life Mozart. With the extended addition there is a scene with sexual nudity and the word c**t is used. That version is rated R, so watch out if kids are watching that version. If the schools watch it they should stick to the theatrical edition. Even though the theatrical edition is rated PG, it really is more deserving of PG-13. It has sensuality and a lot of drinking. Mozart gets drunk in the movie. Overall it's a great film. Mozart was a great composer and I show big respect and remembrance for him on Memorial day and his birthday. I recommend that kids watch this movie because it gives them a great history lesson. I think they will enjoy it.

After defeating the Titans, the Gods created mortals, whose faith & prayers would assure their immortality. However, through time, the mortals lose their faith in the Gods so they stop praying and also destroy a statue of Zeus. To punish the mortals' defiance, Hades is given leave by Zeus to go to the city of Argos to tell King Cepheus & Queen Cassiopeia that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Gods, he will release the Kracken to destroy them & their city. Perseus, who lost his family when Hades arrived, learns here that he is a demigod, son to Zeus, and that he is the only one who can defeat the Gods and save Argos.

Devout fans of the original 1981 Clash of the Titans will probably hate this film without even seeing it and will treat it as some sort of blasphemy but in all honesty this version is actually a very decent remake. Is it better? Well, yes and no. It's not any better (or worse for that matter) for telling a version of the story of Perseus defeating the Kracken, but it's obviously miles better in showing that story with the acting, action, and the visuals.

Obviously the original version is extremely dated now, but it's still a classic in it's own right, and while the effects will probably be laughed at by a lot of people these days, for 1981 they were cutting edge and were well done, especially for the time. Will this be classed as a classic? I very much doubt it, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching and it doesn't mean that both cannot be enjoyed just as much equally.

The visuals & the effects are fantastic all round, especially for the Kracken, and while the Medusa scenes were decent, I must admit the original film's showing was better, not because of the action or the effects, but because of the sheer mood & creepy atmosphere. Even to this day, I remember watching those scenes when I was about 7 or 8 and being genuinely creeped out.

This isn't a jaw-dropper by any stretch, but it's still a very good movie.

I actually enjoyed this film.

I like the continuation of the saga, showing how the evil empire and the Emperor came about. The politics and machinations like a sci-fi borgias.

I thought Liam Neelson and Ewen Mcgregor a little 'wooden' and particularly found McGregors English hoity toity accent annoying.

I can understand others annoyance with jar jar but on the whole I think the film worked reasonably well and fitted in with the saga

Unlike 'The Force Awakens' which makes no attempt to fit or even be original. At least the phantom menace has a plot, and makes the attempt to be part of the saga.

It's not 'brilliant' but nor is it rubbish and certainly watchable Sci-Fi particularly if you enjoyed its preceding films

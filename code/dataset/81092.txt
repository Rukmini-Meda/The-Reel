A marketing/publicity stunt made everyone aware that the ancient Mayans predicted the end of the world on 21 Dec 2012. This is the movie that cashed in on that prophecy. It turns out that the world didn't end, nor did the Mayans actually claim that it would.

The film is yet another Roland Emmerich blockbuster that boasts stupid CGI, pointless chase scenes with various vehicles, characters with melodramatic personal lives and mind-numbing dialogue (delivered by rather good actors, actually.) The villains of the film are the forces of nature themselves, along with corrupt officials who didn't prepare accordingly. The plot is twistless and follows random paths that lead nowhere.

If you liked The Day After Tomorrow you'll probably like this, too.

A Beautiful Mind is a fantastic true story of John Nash who is suffering from an illness which is making him struggle with his Math work at the University. To make matters worse, he gets involved in with a conspiracy with the Russians.

The film has almost perfect directing by Ron Howard and the acting by Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connoly is also perfect, it is so very much deserving of the 4 Academy Awards. The Film although had some inaccuracies with real life.

I would recommend this film to everyone interested in the life of John Nash. A must watch.

When will Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin learn? I guess when they finally run out of disaster ideas. They already ruined Godzilla, capitalized on global warming and had aliens take a shot at world domination. It's only natural that he'd hurry up make this film before a director with actual talent got a chance to. After watching those barely acceptable films, along with "10, 000 B.C." in all its maligned light, I honestly didn't have high expectations for this film. And what a coincidence, the duo presented audiences with a predictable family melodrama weighed down by overly done action sequences.

I can't lie say there aren't some captivating and mouth-dropping shots, but the humor seems to never let up. Even as the world crumbles to pieces and society is at the end of its rope. A perfectly good time to tell a joke or two, don't you think? The same old formula of a divorced family getting back together after the step father is conveniently killed during the chaos is put to use, yawn. As a result I end up not giving a rat's *ss about any of the characters. In fact, it would've played out better if everyone would've simply died. How many cliches and comedy must I suffer? If the film had been marketed as a comedy then I would've honestly given it a higher score (maybe a 5 or 6) but instead it was portrayed in trailers as the end of all epicness. What a laugh.

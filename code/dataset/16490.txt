This was just all kinds of awesome however it also is what it is, and doesn't make any excuses for it. If you go into The Expendables with the right mindset, wanting an adrenaline charged, flat out action movie with over the top explosions, car chases, knuckle grinding fights, bullets & bloodshed galore, and just all out amazing action sequences then you will absolutely love it. And that's exactly what I did, sitting in the theatre with my family and literally cheering along with the audience, it was so much fun.

There were also some surprisingly soft and touching scenes here, including one with Mickey Rourke. I enjoyed the story for exactly what it was, loved all the guys and their banter, the fantastic cameos, and the references to action movies of the past. Stallone was in top form, Eric Roberts was the perfect bad guy, Statham (gah) always fine, Jet Li -funny (who knew) Terry Crew's big gun just killed me and left my ears ringing, awesome! 12. 22.13

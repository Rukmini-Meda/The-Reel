Out of the prequels this is my favorite and second from the whole saga(first is empire strikes back).

It has great effects, awesome music, good direction and the acting a bit flat at times but over it i am. The pacing might be slow at times but the action makes it over it. The pod racing, battle sequences and Coruscant scenes are the plus points of the movie. It truly doesn't deserve the bashing it gets.

A great way to have a foundation of one of the biggest movie series and truly deserving a lot of praise.

Nice job George Lucas.

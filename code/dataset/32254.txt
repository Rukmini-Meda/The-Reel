One of my closed ones has schizophrenia. To write review of this movie is to make sense of what I have understood about this mental illness in short.

First of all I would like to talk about this movie. The movie is great, still to have clear idea regarding this illness I would suggest you to see a documentary. I did saw documentary named 'John Nash A Brilliant madness'.

It's every day struggle for the people suffering from this disease. They have to become strong and learn to distinguish between delusions, hallucinations and truth. The one who learns and adopt this practice overcomes and manages to become stable. This peculiar feature also highlights in john, and is shown nicely.

After watching the movie and documentary, I concluded the movie to be little away from happened incidence in John Nash life. It seemed to me Russell Crowe was wrong choice. He was brilliant but when you see the documentary you see a totally different John.

Having such illness, it becomes burden on one's family and colleagues, the social relations and family who takes care do worth much more are rare to find, as shown in movie.

Everything in this world, living beings, non- living beings, beings which are conscious and beings which are not conscious have working relation between them that can be projected via rules of maths. Not all people get glimpse of this working relations. One of them who got the idea regarding this, was John Nash.

Movie highly recommended.

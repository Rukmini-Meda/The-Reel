 This is the one of musical movies. Some people don't like musical movies, but actually, I like that. Some people says singing suddenly is very strange and I agree with that, but I don't care about that so much because the songs characters sing shows their feeling so well. In this movie, all dialog is in songs, so it's a little bit different than usual musical movies. One thing I want to say is the way to shoot this movie is very fantastic! When people shoot musical movies, before the shooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without singing when they shoot. But this movie takes different way. Actors put ear monitor on and sing with listening only piano. Actors sing the way they want to sing, so they can act and sing very naturally. So actors in this movies have great and wonderful skills. This movie shows a view of the Les Miserables world so well. We can enjoy everything about Les Miserables same as the play.

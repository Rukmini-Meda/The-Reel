I liked the movie because there was more action than explaining comparing to Reloaded. I really liked dramatic scene where people of Zion fought against machines. Of course there's lot of philosophy to find other weird things for example how Neo killed Smith -program and how he can destroy machines easily in the real world. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad when the movie doesn't explain some scenes for example how/why Seraph survived when he was with The Oracle. At least it gives freedom to figure it out by yourself.

I recommend this movie not only to Matrix -fans but also to people who like movies where a strong faith in something wins the sense and impossible becomes possible.

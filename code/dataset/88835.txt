AVATAR is the best movie that I have ever seen.When I watch this film,I remember another world.A world with fantastic people and creatures.Watching this film is a ... a good experience for creating in your mind the power for control powerful creature and become a captain.Also I forgot to say about the effects of film, they was amazing!!!

Of course I have seen a lot of films but when I saw Avatar "I lost my mind"!!Sam Worthington was perfect for this movie and in his role was a legend!

I want to be an actor like Sam Worthington because he is my favorite actor.

The Matrix Revolutions is said to be the final installment of the Matrix movies and is said to close out the series. As entertaining as it was it leaves the viewer with unanswered question as the first two did but in a whole different sense. The film certainly puts to rest the rumors that Zion city was part of the matrix. It also has a climactic ending for the future of the city and the battle between Neo and Agent Smith BUT WHAT BECOMES OF NEO??? What becomes of the Matrix world now that the people it contains will have the option to be free...what is to become of those people?

All in all it was a good movie but it leaves too many questions with infinite answers we shouldn't be stuck pondering. Quite simply the answers are boring to imagine with the gaping wound of an ending we are left to close. I myself would bet even if it's not for 5 years there just may be ONE final installment. This films plot was simple, the storyline simple and the ending was also very very simple. There was less explanation of things and the films primary action was the battle with the robots. Not a lot of hyped up Kung-Fu fights in this flick. Anyone satisfied by this movie as the final installment has low standards and wasn't expecting or asking for much at all for their dollar. That's quite sad really. Synapsis: dull storyline, great action and the thinnest plot of all three movies. I very much enjoyed it but was left feeling unsettled by the ending and yes some what disappointed.

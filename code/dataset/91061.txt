Somewhere towards the end, there was a scene where the machines and the humans were watching the end battle between Neo and Smith, and one of the humans asked Morpheus how many "Smiths" there were, and Morpheus could have turned and looked at him and said: "OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Cause really, that's about the extent of the intellectualism that this movie had.

Sure it was a finality, and a closer. Yes, we get it Neo is the archetype Messiah, and sacrifice, and in the end there is peace, and the prophecy is fulfilled, and yadda yadda yadda.

But really who cares? The machines ultimately won anyways. They still need the humans to survive because the sky is still black. And what human in his or her right mind would want to "wake up" in a world that is basically a charred lifeless version of itself.

Earth effectively is a dead planet.

And even so, living in the Matrix is ultimately where you could gain enlightenment and "free your mind".

Sure you could argue that the real lesson was synergy and co-existing with one another, which is nice and all. But if you think about it, the machines will always win.

And really, we are to believe that a whole race of machines that are able to create the greatest MMORPG in existence, build hovercrafts, and find ways to convert humans into batteries couldn't once figure out how to clean up the sky, which ultimately would erase the need for humans in the first place? I mean c'mon?! In the end, this movie was more just an all out fight scene. The CGI was fantastic, the Cinematography was incredible, but the "woah" factor that made the first one had simply disappeared.

Fortunately, the only real reason to watch this is for the eye candy. There isn't much to be gained as far as knowledge or philosophy, unlike the original. In fact, one could watch the first one, and be perfectly content without having seen the second or the third.

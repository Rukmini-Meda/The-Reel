Not seen such good one for some long time. very nice...! good effects, and exciting plot. I give it a straight 10 of course. Movies are meant to be like these.

Liked the underworld and god / devil visualisations. Incredibly done on the special effects, landscapes, casting and plot. The story tells a lot about humankind and basics in our lives.

Don't understand underestimated preceding reviews, i cannot agree with them. Then again i'm not Zeus. HaHa

Excited from begin till end and want to watch it again soon.

Not going to tell the plot just see for yourself!!

Generally the movie was quite exciting. The narrow escapes in LA to get to the plane and even after the plane left the airport were great. Thank goodness there were no sex scenes as far as I can remember so as to further distract from the movie. The distractions and cuteness of the kids was enough along with the camping scenes.

I would argue that the end of the world scenario would have been more accurate from my point of view if the Earth would have simply been destroyed by being burned up by the sun or the Earth would have split into two parts due to the tremendous pressure built up inside of the Earth. That would have been interesting to see all the water and matter flowing out into space. The flood ending reminded me of Noah's ark.

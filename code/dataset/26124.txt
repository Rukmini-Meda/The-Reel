 Yes, the script is respectful both to the novel and to the stage show, which is no mean feat, but as a movie and a musical ? Positive reviews to THIS? Have people lost their hearing? Arrangements and direction are dreadful. Lack of good support, crying and muttering destroy most performances. Only Samantha Barks sounds decent. Hugh Jackman tries his best but his amateurish singing! How could his Bring him home stay in the movie? Eddie Redmayne makes Nick Jonas - earnest and likable Marius with mediocre nasal voice - sound like Michael Ball. There are many great Fantines, Ruthie Henshall maybe the best. Anne Hathaway, however, is irritating. Yes, as a tortured, dying prostitute FANTINE has reason to cry and moan, but this is - wait for it - musical. Hathaway won Oscar because the Academy likes to see lot of drab, ugly movies about human suffering, that makes True Art. True Art looks crap, sounds crap, is crap! No, it's not crap. Just worst musical I have ever heard.

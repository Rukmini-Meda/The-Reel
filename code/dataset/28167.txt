 I don't understand all the pure hate shown for this movie. It's a disaster movie wrapped up in an end of the world storyline. Did anyone expect to actually learn anything from it? It's just entertainment. Mindless entertainment, really, but it's a fun ride. There needs to be a certain suspension of belief on the viewer's part. Of course it's not realistic, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be suspenseful and take you for a fun ride, while trotting out some decent special effects. I didn't see it in the theater, so I didn't pay anything to watch it. I enjoyed it. I advise you not be put off by the somewhat rambling...totally picky reviews and give it a try.

Woe are ye critics who went into the theater expecting a character driven biopic. Stallone neither builds a computer nor does he solve Enigma in this film, however, I'm sure Dolph Lundgren could.

This movie is a muscle fest of TRT and TNT. It's like a bodybuilding convention being held inside Cabela's.

Where it fails is where it should have been more cheesy. We finally get to see Lundgren, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Statham, etc, in a movie together, and it's a bloody lead fest with a toned up love story of attachment when the only attachments should be a foregrip and an ACOG.

Character idiosyncratic combat is great. Statham with knives, Stallone's revolver, Crew's shotgun, Dolph's blade, and Li's fists. Even the hand-to -hand allowed all the characters to bleed their own specific choreography into what felt like a live-action Mortal Kombat meets Commando meets When Mustang Met Sally (er, uh, Harry.)

All in all, a satisfying movie that just left me wanting more of what could have been, should have been, and has-been.

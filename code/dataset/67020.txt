I will not bash this film based on being different from the ancient myths anymore than I will bash the 1981 version of the tale. These films draw inspiration from the ancient stories - not a carbon copy of the original Greek stories. This 2010 film is also not a carbon copy of the 1981 film, just like other "remakes" they have changes to create a variant instead of exact duplicates. Duplicate films are redundant and pointless while variants of the same story creates variety - and variety is the spice of life.

With all the above being said, I like this version of the myth. Myths are simply stories and stories entertain us. Variants of stories are good, it's nice to see our beloved ancient gods and goddesses in a bit different way.

No this film is NOT exactly like the original myth, but neither is the 1981 version. I prefer the 1981 over the 2010 but I do like this 2010 version.

6.5/10

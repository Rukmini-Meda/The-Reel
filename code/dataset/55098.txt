For the entertaining aspect, this movie surely enjoyable. It has an easy plot, good performances, with movie goers directing style. Besides that, the cinematography is a little bit above average. But i'm sorry to say this but, this movie is just an average. 70-75 rating no more.

The one thing we must appreciate is Ron Howard himself. He was really versatile as a director. He can direct such many kind of genres. Early 21th he made such a good entertaining drama-biography movie "A Beautiful Mind". Later, he made a mystery "Angel and Demon" and "Da Vinci Code". Another time he made a sport "Rush". Far before them, he made sci-fi "Apollo 13". Wow that was bunch wide genres.

This movie has been weaken by the director himself in some way. Hollywood has a culture to change the way the plot goes on. And that happened in "A Beautiful Mind". Maybe Hollywood want to change this movie into something more enjoyable and light. It's alright, we definitely can't judge a movie from the inaccuracy of it's plot. But they change it into something uninspiring, a little bit melodramatic, and untemperament. That was really not good for this kind of genre (drama biography based on true story). It's not match at all, it's blunt.

Although Ed Harris and Crowe's performances were good (not superb). And also the cinematography. That's all that rise this movie rating into 70+. My recommendation is, just try to enjoy this movie. For a movie-goers I'm sure it will work.

Excellent!!!!!!!! The characters,the story...it has action,sf,love-story,it really touches you. I still love this movie...me and another few billions;-) At the beginning I was a little bit suspicious:blue people,animated movie..but it is nothing like that.The actors really worked hard in order to make this to look real........I also liked the story...I really could feel like I was a part of Pandora,I wanted to be a character,to join them saving that beautiful world.I loved Neytiri,they made a good job,very beautiful.Congratulations to the team and ,of course,to my favorite director,James Cameroon. I really hope that the next Avatars parts will bring me joy as this one did.Good job!

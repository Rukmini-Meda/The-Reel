Okay, I was way late to the party on this movie, but nothing I had heard about it made me want to go out of my way to see it. Finally it showed up on cable this past summer. Now I know what I was missing.

Actually, nothing about the story gave me any problems. I could even tolerate the characters, although they were pretty shallow compared to previous episodes.

My issue was with the acting. It was intolerable. To be fair, it may have been the direction or script, but even given these outs, these were some of the most wooden, flat, and horrible performances I have ever seen. To an actor, they were just awful. Even the Emperor sounded like he was mailing this one in.

In the sports world, you would accuse this group of taking a dive. I'm not even going to give them that much credit. I'm skipping episodes 2 and 3 completely. There doesn't seem to be any reason to watch them if they are anything like the first. This was a horrible way to take an outstanding franchise and ruin it.

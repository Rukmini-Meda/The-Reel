 This film never took itself seriously and was bashed critically. It isn't art and doesn't try to be. It isn't dramatic and doesn't try to be. It tries to be a ton of fun and succeeds, mostly, in the regard. It is also aware of itself as a film: the dialogue makes the viewer understand that the actors are in a movie and not taking anything seriously which wasn't the right decision in my mind because it weakened the film too much: it became too dull and lacked any dramatic impact as I knew everything wasn't happening "for real" and since this film isn't art: it's soundtrack and visuals aren't artsy but are simple action tropes, thus it cannot be understood as art but only as an action movie that depends on tension to create a situation.

This movie was the mother of all missed opportunities.

First off, I never once believed that the World was going to come to an end in 2012. But despite that, I still enjoyed this movie, its not a bad movie, it just could have been so much better than it is.

I am a Science Fiction writer, and there were several things that I would have down sooooo... different.

for one, I would have given this movie a proper movie title that would've given it a shelf life beyond 2012. I would have named it "The Great Cancellation" or something like that.

secondly, I would have those Ark ships as Space ships (as the movies has us to believe until they actually find them)...yes, I would have made those space ships. Then I would have ended the movie with those space ships blasting off into space, the survivors would've watched from space as the Earth's crust melts into liquid magma.... then I would've ended it with those space ships floating through space towards destination unknown......

If they would have done as I suggested, then this might could have been the beginning of a great new Sci-Fi movie series that follows the survivors of Earth as they look for a new home in the stars...that could have been an exciting movie series, but instead we are left with "2012" a movie that has amazing special effects, a short shelf life and not much more....Yes, this is the mother is missed opportunities. Too Bad, So Sad.

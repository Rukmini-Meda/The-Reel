The movie was fully entertaining , with all the stunning visual effects, explosions , the volcanoes , Tsunamis ...you name it. Rolland Emerich managed to put all kinds of disasters that can ( cant ) ever happen in the world together and managed to make a movie out of it.

The movie does have some ..infact many plot holes.. you cant just run away from an earth quake in a limo you should be lucky to have a wife whose lover coincidentally happens to be a pilot... you happen to know someone on the ship who can get you inside of it without paying the single penny... AND you have to be lucky enough to be working for Russian billionaire who is actually going to board the ship and can offer a ride in his plane..........

I should say John Cusack is the luckiest guy on earth if such a disaster happens.

But if we set aside all those things and watch it like movie ,,it is entertaining as hell..It is pretty much impossible but I loved the Earthquake sequence where John Cusack and his family escape in a limo.. Visual Effects were stunning and no one can deny that...

If you are looking for complete all action and entertainment flick then this is it... However if you are looking for a Shakespeare then please don't go for it...

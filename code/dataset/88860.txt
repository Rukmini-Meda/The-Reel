 I must admit it. I could not watch the whole movie. I left the theater much earlier. So many good actors, such many potentials. And yet, spoiled by the continuous ( I mean really unstoppable singing) They could have made a musical (even though I really dislike musicals), containing some songs , but not this. Every line was sung!!!! Every line!!! I could not even watch anymore. I tried to stay, to make my ticket money count, but I could not anymore. All the actors were singing, watching the camera face to face. Everything was so terrible. Except the costumes. I would not suggest this movie to anyone. I can't probably understand HOW this thing made it to the top movies.

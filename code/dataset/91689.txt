I absolve you all.

Man and his request for glory often go unanswered. So it is for Salieri, so it is for all of us disciplined in mediocrity.

Amadeus lets us understand the great composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with a familiarity I never imagined possible. He was but a man, a man like you or I, a man of uncultured talent. And when I say uncultured I frame it in the highest regard. For the man without culture, the man who receives the people's love despite this has created his own and that cannot be touched.

To hear his work is to hear the voice of God whomever that may be.

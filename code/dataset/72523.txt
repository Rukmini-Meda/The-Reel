This movie is actually good. Beautiful choreography paired with amazing cinematography, although there are some pretty bad lines, give this film an amazing feel. Although you don't need this film to finish the rest of the saga, likable characters and amazing saber fights with dips and dives not imagined will have you wanting to see more. Arguably the best of the prequels of the amazing adventure of a series. Watch this movie without adding it to the rest of the movies to get the best feel and an amazing standalone film. Don'fall into the bandwagon of hating this movie! I loved it as you will too. Of you liked any of the Star Wars movies, you'll understand how good this film really is.

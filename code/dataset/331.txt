I see that I am not alone, other people were dissapointed with this pathetic,decidely tawdry attempt at a film. The first movie had the right aesthetic blend of visuals coupled with some interesting philosophical questioning. Matrix 3 Revolutions does not have a single bone of originality contained within its rather sad, scrawny little frame. Instead it is reduced to the self referential, with the same moves and same scenes from the original film being endlessly repeated. Transparently the film grafts off ideas from the Star Wars movie's in terms of not only themes - (the flight of the nebuchednezzar through the dimly lit tunnels of Zion will remind many film aficianados of the millenium falcon's journey through the Death Star in Return Of The Jedi) - but music, too. The hydraulically devised robotic suits that the defenders of Zion don to defend their city from the enemy are blatant derivatives of the loader mechanism used by Ripley in Alien. The action sequences are disparately littered throughout the course of this nearly three hour film, with the majority of its content being devoted to mind numbingly boring exchanges between Neo and Trinity, Neo and Oracle etc (you know the drill: dull, soporific dialogues along the lines of 'Ah, but Neo you know', 'ah, but I don't', 'but you do really'...just get to the f*****g point Oracle. If you know the answer just tell him!) Who did they hire to write this godawful mess, the scriptwriters of Sunset Beach?

Revolutions: it might just make you dizzy...spend your five pounds on something worthwhile like 'Watching Paint Dry Weekly', you might get more of an adrenaline kick out of it! 0.5 out of ten!

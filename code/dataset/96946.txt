 With John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt all in the same movie you have to assume there will be some action, some anti-establishment messages and great performances. It does and it is a BIG movie with a lot of very ambitious CGI, and great locations. A very interesting end of the world movie that portrays some great heroics, sacrifices and humor. It would be easy to throw back a few beers and lightly watch this film, but you would miss a lot of the subplots the production company works very hard to weave throughout the story. Government cover-ups, assassination, conspiracy theorist. Full of Hero's and villains, the ending is satisfying and surprising. I loved it. I never have been disappointed in a movie with John Cusack.

THis is a beautiful story, but the reality is not beautiful at all. There are some real biography I searched: First, their son did not attend to Harvard, their son also suffers from schizophrenia. Second, Nash and Alicia divorced after Nash occurred his psycho problems. Yet they been lived together in a same house. And remarried after the movie released. So I believed there is only a little romance appeared in reality. According to Dr. Nash's interview, it seems like he healed himself without medication but by his strong will. Third, Nash was in love with a nurse before Alicia, and they have an elder son.

Lastly, no matter how, john Nash is a genius for no doubt. Thank you for your review.

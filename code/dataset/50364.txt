The Expendables is a wild action movie, a story about a team of mercenaries called the Expendables, led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), on a CIA mission to eliminate Latin dictator David Zayas (General Garza) and renegade CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts).

I actually saw The Expendables 2 and 3 before I saw this one. I've found it to have the same adrenaline pumping and no-nonsense plot, mixed in with some drama and humor where needed. There are also plenty of weaponry action, highlighted with wild special/visual effects that will sure make your head spin, and martial arts galore, including those brilliantly done by Jet Li.

However, I've also found that this first movie has a more serious and darker tone than its sequels and contained more violence, which were more than I could handle at times. The plot dragged a little at a few points throughout the film, especially during the scenes with Mickey Rourke's character.

I actually thought that the series works better with the added humor in them as found in Parts 2 and 3, but, the movie is still pretty good fun and is great for seeing the many action legends from the 1980s and 1990s together (Stallone, Lundgren, Li, Willis, Scharzenegger).

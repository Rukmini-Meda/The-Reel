 For professional musician it gives another perception of this genius mind. E.g., thought of how he was flawless, non-sinner, very mature and actually perfect, is proved wrong. Maybe not every detail in this movie is true, but it makes us look different at him. Like a human, not god. For all other people this movie can be a true wake up call to see that classical music is not boring, but just the opposite! Anyway, it gives us great impression of life (and even night life) at that time, admiration and compassion for one of the most brilliant composers ever. Also, personally I find leading actor as great reflection of Mozart. It is a must-see movie!

Alright, so I know that this film isn't anywhere near being historically accurate but ... It's still bloody amazing. Say what you like but literally everything in this movie is just god damn beautiful. The acting is ... out of this world from F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, the plot is so gripping and powerful at the same time and the music ... Oh the music. I don't think I've ever been more blown away by a film's soundtrack. And I have to confess that I'm not even that big a fan of Mozart at all to be honest, but during this film ... It's hard to put into words but I guess the best way would be say that it's like you forget every piece of music you've ever heard before. And to be honest to talk about the inaccuracies of the story, there really isn't a lot that can't be ignored for the sake of enjoying this beautiful, creepy and incredibly intense masterpiece of film making. No It might not be the most honest to life movie but that doesn't take away from the work of art that it truly is.

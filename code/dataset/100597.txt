you know, it is understandable to see why many were unsatisfied with the final installment of the matrix trilogy. my only complaint b eing is that this movie was just a continuation of reloaded and enter the matrix. however, is that a bad thing? if anything one could admire the boldness of a movie not following the typical Hollywood pattern of trilogy. that principle being that each movie has to have a wide stream of circumstances to complete that movie; when in fact this movie simply gave us a wide barrage of action and a subtle conclusion. i think that is why many were disappointed with it. to see our hero neo have such a simple demise rather than a strong, hardcore, and victorious defeat. the actual ending though confusing was appropriate as well. and to all of the viewers who were annoyed by the intricate dialouge of the movie, i have to ask why would you be surprised at this. i know it must suck to have to watch a movie or scene over and over to fully understand a part. but ask yourself this, how many times did you have to watch the first movie to get a clear and concise understanding of that world. for those who were upset that the majority of fighting took place in the real world rather than the matrix...........SO WHAT!!! i for one was pleased that the fighting was happening here as opposed to the matrix. why, because these characters fight so hard in the matrix, it was nice to see the world that these people were fight so valiantly to protect. notto mention that there was a terrific final fight in the super burly brawl between neo and his nemesis agent smith. i could give many other retorts to problems but that would be pointless. i can only say that i would suggest this movie to anyone and would also protest that this is a phenomenal ending to such a pivotal trilogy. 8 out of 10 stars!!!

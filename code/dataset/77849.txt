when film starts and i see a person who has challenging in his own brain and life to create a world better with his opinion and that's called by mathematics , so far at the end of the movie that was best and fascinating job . i think the best part of the movie is the characterizations of actors . they seems not like playing an actor. its like they're own life and living in it . this part had a very good score. i could not imagine whats real and whats not when i was for the first time watching it , but in second time it bounded in my bones and thought me love is not that quite simple as we see. i can explain it and everyone should see the movie , its a masterpiece .

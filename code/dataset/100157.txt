Les Miserables in one of the best stage musicals ever made. Unfortunately, the transition to film on this occasion was poor and surprisingly, the cast was about 70% of the problem.

Val Jean should be a powerful voice that projects intensity and wisdom. Jackman was light-musical and it really didn't cut it....

Crowe was wooden and completely miscast. That's a part that a good actor could flesh out, but Rusty was complete underwhelming. His voice was nothing to write home about.

Marius, Enjorlas,... fairly weak when they should project a bit of power and substance. Anna Hathaway was OK, but the part of Fontine is strange. It does not feature in most of the show, yet often draws praise. Didn't deserve the Oscar.

The most dreadful aspect was the Thenardiers. Sasha and Helen BC had limitless opportunities to give a great injection of comic relief and really have fun with it. Instead, they ended up totally stale, uninspired and somewhat creepy. The actors almost skipped over (Rather than emphasize) their great lines.

In the end, this was a real disappointment for someone who was a big fan. Didn't even think much of the sets and staging. What they should have done is made a movie using a good ensemble cast built of Les Mis stage performers from around the world. Bringing in the big names actually backfired on this occasion.

Russel Crowe here gives one of the best performances ever. I liked also the tiny visual effects used, in a very gentle way. Especially the math scenes. All the other actors played very well but Russel gave a real meaning to entire film. The music was amazing. Cinematography could be stronger. The editing was perfect. The movie fascinated me about the life of this man, and I sought more information, finding that for many years he was a recluse, wandering the campus, talking to no one, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, paging through piles of newspapers and magazines. The ending...oh my God the ending was amazing. His final speech is the real meaning of love.

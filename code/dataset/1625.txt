Oh boy. This is not going to be pretty.

Pros

- Liam Neeson delivers a nice performance as Qui-Gon Jinn. He's believable as a quiet Jedi Master who has more than a bit of the maverick in him.

- John Williams' score. Not his best, but it's pretty good.

- The final lightsaber battle is an engaging fight sequence. Some nice pacing; it's not just constant action like some of the later prequel fights seem to be.

- Watto is a fun character, if you can look past whatever racial stereotype he represents (is he supposed to be Jewish? Middle Eastern?).

Cons

- Let's get this one out of the way first: Jar Jar Binks. I don't think I need to expand on this.

- Script is bloody terrible. Three sixth-graders could have come up with a better Star Wars screenplay than this one. Dialogue ranges from criminally boring to painfully, facepalmingly awful.

- The cast's performances are generally wooden. Samuel L. Jackson seems bored. Ian McDiarmid doesn't have much to work with. (Actually, let me stop myself before I go on: nobody in the film really has much to work with. Yes, there is bad acting, but the script is not Shakespeare, as I said. Anyway, back to the performances.) Keira Knightley delivers her lines like she's that one hopeless student in an acting class who has no hope of ever being much of an actress but goes on anyway, stone faced and vapid, droning on into oblivion. Jake Lloyd makes me want to punch a brick wall, in anticipation that the pain may distract me from his cringiness. And so on and so forth.

- I touched on Jar Jar, of course, but the Gungans in general are an annoyance. Their very mode of talking ceases to be fun once you reach the age of 10.

- The Neimodians (those guys in charge of the Trade Federation) are some of the most blatant Asian stereotypes you'll find. Either that, or George was in a Benadryl-induced fog when coming up with them, failing to notice what should have been obvious. I find them entertaining in a train-wreck sort of way, but I hate myself for it.

- Visuals are ultimately a misstep. Too clean and too fake, though these shortcomings were more apparent in the other two prequels.

- The Midichlorians are stupid.

- I'm sure there's more and I just can't remember all of it.

The Verdict

I'd really rather not watch this film ever again, but I probably will out of boredom, amusement, or masochism...I'm not sure which. An utter failure of a film.

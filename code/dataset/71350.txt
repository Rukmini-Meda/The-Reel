This movie sucks. Never have I ever wasted 3 hours of my life on something this bad and this underwhelming. I can understand that the visual effects were good at the time it was made. But now this movie is just plain bad. The acting is so shallow and the plot is incredibly stupid. There's no good reason this movie should have won any Oscars, let alone even have been nominated for any. If someone asked me to see this movie with them, I would call 911. You can't be sure if someone is not insane if they even pretend to like this movie

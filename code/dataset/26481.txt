Brilliant action film, tons of explosions, good humour, amazing! One of the best action movies of recent years, doesn't take itself too seriously and it being a box office success goes to show that action movies today does not have to use that serious and realistic Bourne look that people seem to copy these days. This is a throwback to the 80s and 90s films where you had Schwarzenegger and Stallone piling up the bodies of bad guys, creating characters with cheesy yet memorable quotes. Sly Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis (in a small role) were brilliant. Although it was just one scene, it was nice to see Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film with Bruce and Sly. Definitely worth watching if you love those guys.

It was unfortunate that Jean Claude Van Damme turned down a role in this film, luckily he got a role in the sequel EXPENDABLES 2.

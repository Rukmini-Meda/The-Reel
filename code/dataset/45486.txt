 I like John Cusack. He usually makes some pretty good movies. This movie is a dog. I know movies stretch the imagination, but this one wants you to remove you head and not even think. The physics are just WAAAAAAY to hard to believe. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are nowhere near as big as they are in this movie. And its just a stupid plot all together.

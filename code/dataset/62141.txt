I honestly don't get why people say this is a bad movie. I think it's quite enjoyable. I mean, I don't love it, but it is a lot better than many disaster movies before this. And when it comes to disaster movies, you don't have a lot of choice. Unless it's just one disaster, like Twister. This is one of the only disaster movies that I really enjoy that has several different themes. Earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, tidal waves, and other really cool natural disasters that people love watching but would never want it to really happen.

In this movie, Jackson Curtis, a divorced man with two kids, who drives a limo and is also an author, takes his children on a camping trip. It's there that he finds out that the world is going to end. He finds out that there are ships being built where you can safely live after the apocalypse. A ticket will just cost you about $1 billion. Yeah, so you know all the rich snobs are going to be the only people living on Earth. How depressing? Lots of stuff happens, including Los Angeles being destroyed and falling into a giant sink hole, whilst Jackson gets his kids, ex-wife, and ex-wife's current-husband to Yellowstone National Park. Then they fly to Las Vegas (I think it was Vegas) and see one of Jackson's clients, a Russian billionaire who just happens to need another pilot, and the current-husband just happens to be one. So they fly away whilst the city is destroyed. They fly over Hawaii, where they were meant to refuel, but the state is busy being destroyed by lava. That's super creepy when you know it could really happen. Eventually, the Russian guy and his family are taken to the ships and Jackson and his company must sneak onto the ship before they die.

Fun Fact: This movie was banned in North Korea.

Fun Fact: Seth Rogen turned down the role of Adrian Hemsley.

Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

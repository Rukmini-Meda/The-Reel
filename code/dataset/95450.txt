Episode 1 is a bad movie and I can understand why people must have been so disappointed with the outcome one of the most hyped movies of all time and it sucks. In my opinion episode 2 is the worst but episode 1 is still a bad movie. Now a lot comes down to the acting its not believable not saying the acting in Star wars is top notch because its not but everyone sucks in this movie especially Jake Lloyd who was awful in this movie but in my opinion slightly better then Hayden Christian who was awful in episode 2 and a bit better in episode 3. The script now am not gonna say its awful because its not but I wouldn't have Anakin be a 10 year old kid I would have him be roughly 17 years old and is Obi Wans Pad wan because the prequel trilogy is suppose to show Anakin fall from being a Jedi not him becoming a Jedi then becoming a Sith. Now the villain of the movie Darth Maul one of the best and underused Star wars characters. Darth Maul should have been the villain though the whole trilogy right until the end. Now on to Jar Jar Binks I hate that piece of crap he was there to have the comedy aspect in the movie but couldn't do that Jar Jar is awful at everything he does and if he is a secret Sith lord I would be fine with that probably.

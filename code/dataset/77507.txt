Russell Crowe does an awesome job. As the tortured but brilliant math professor John Forbes Nash. As it shows him how he began his math career as a student and how he got to work at the Pentagon and university.

Where he met and married his wife, Alicia played by Oscar winner supporting actress Jennifer Connolly. As she has to suffer with him through thick and thin and manages to stay by him regardless. Showing she is taken for a ride but she is so devoted to him.

Crowe meanwhile is tasked by government agent, Ed Harris to help out on a top secret mission. While also befriending his college friend, Paul Bettany and a little girl, can't think of her name just yet.

His wife claims to a psychologist Christopher Plummer that she feels her husband is ill and is worried about him. But is Nash does not seem to be knowing what is real and not. Meaning the latter, is it all in his head?

Great acting, writing, and really a great directing effort by Ron Howard and a great score by James Horner!

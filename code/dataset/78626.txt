 When sitting back as a kid being a fan of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and so on movies you always thought what would happen if they were all in the same movie. Well even though the showdown between the 3 mega Planet Hollywood partners is going to be saved for the sequels and they only had a quick non action scene in this movie it's still great to see Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke and so on share the screen with each other in kick butt fight scenes. If you don't like this movie then you should stick with your Glee DVDs and American Idol recordings on your DVR since I highly question if you're a real mans man.

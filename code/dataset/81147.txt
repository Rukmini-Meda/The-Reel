 The great epic biopic, about the great epic artist himself. What's so fascinating about it, is it's style. It's refusal to be pretentious. If that's not enough, it mocks pretension by using Antonio Salieri. He's just so insufferably envious of Mozart, that he inadvertently kills him. Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself. Without prior knowledge, you'd leave the film thinking that this whole time, he was an idiot savant. But perhaps, Mozart is just as colorful as his punk rock wigs... at least that would be what we all would hope for. While I don't think it's Milos Forman's best film, it's a magnificent achievement, and for the grand majority of it's 3 hours, it's engrossing.

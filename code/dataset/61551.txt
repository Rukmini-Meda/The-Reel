Humans battle CGI in "Clash of The Titans", both equally one dimensional.

The film is mostly terrible, but there are some good things here. Ramin Djawadi's score drums up excitement, there is one good action scene and the film manages to avoid being camp and silly, a hard task for these sword and sandal fantasy movies. See Brad Pitt's "Troy" to see how wrong this production could have gone.

The film's portrayal of "Gods" and "Mythical Creatures" lacks power. Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies weren't great, but Jackson knew how to hype up his beasts and wizards with some some good ole fashion bombast. When Jackson's wizards and sorcerers raised their voices, you wet your pants. In "Clash of The Titans", you're counting the seconds till they shut up.

7/10 - The target audience for this film has long abandoned cinema in favour for interactive media. So who is responsible for this film's profit? The middle aged and the elderly.

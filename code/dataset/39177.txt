Do not listen to these butt hurt fanboys. This movie is another great addition to the Star Wars universe. Sure, like every movie, it has some flaws, but overall, this movie is an amazing success. People do not understand that the man who created Star Wars in the first place wrote this one as well. This is how HE wanted it to be. Who cares how YOU wanted it to be. If you don't like it, stfu and gtfo. This movie brought amazing new technology from the old Star Wars, and also wrapped up the awesome ties between old and new. It also brought us some awesome new characters. If you didn't like it, sorry. But for me, as well as REAL Star Wars fans, it was a great success.

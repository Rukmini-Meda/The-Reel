 I was excited to see this film as I love Mozart, am a fan of his work and my dad said it was really good. The beginning started off fine, it was an interesting, memorable opening scene however it went downhill from there! First of all this film shouldn't be named Amadeus after Mozart it should be named after Antonio as the film is all about him! We are introduced to Mozart about 20 minutes, they cast a rubbish American actor, they should have trained him to do a German / Austrian accent, that would have made the film immediately better! Also Mozart acts like an immature retard, maybe he was like that but where is the evidence!? Also the relationship between Antonio and Mozart was ridiculous, Antonio was portrayed as if he murdered Mozart which I don't believe for a second! Overall I only gave this one more star for the music!

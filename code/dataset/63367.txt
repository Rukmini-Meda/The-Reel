Amadeus, despite its title, is really not about Mozart. It is about Salieri, who is the court composer for the Austrian emperor and witnesses Mozart's rise from child prodigy to child-like adult. Salieri wants nothing more than to compose beautiful music, but instead his own mediocrity is made all the more apparent when contrasted to the seemingly divine talent of the impish Wolfgang, which irritates him to no end. Salieri's feelings of inadequacy resonate with anyone who has badly wanted a talent for themselves only to see it "wasted" on someone else who didn't appreciate it.

The movie itself is beautiful in every degree- costumes, set, direction, and especially orchestration. With a soundtrack that is almost completely written by Mozart himself and which helps to guide the film, no other score can come close and the entire spectacle is a treat from start to finish. Though some complain about the lack of realism and introduction of fantasy into the events surrounding Mozart and Salieri, that should not be a deterrent. If you want strict accuracy then watch a documentary or read a book. This movie is meant to entertain, and entertain it does. This is a must see for any film buff, lover of classical music, or for anyone who has ever labored in the shadow of true genius.

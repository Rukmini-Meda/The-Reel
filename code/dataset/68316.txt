Personally, I despise the hate for this movie and the prequel trilogy in general. Sure it has it's flaws but every movie has some. At least Lucas tried new things in the prequel trilogy and tried to make it enjoyable. There is a few good things to the prequels like: The excellent music, Darth Maul, the final battle, and more. Besides, people seem to hate this movie because it's boring. Well, the part where Palptine is trying to convince the senate that he is eligible for the rank of chancellor can be interesting if you just PAY ATTENTION!!! Also, people think young Anakin Skywalker is annoying for the most stupid reasons ever made. He's not a brat, or a bad kid... SO WHY!!! I'll admit though, Jar Jar Binks is pretty annoying though I just IGNORE HIM! Finally, to anyone who hates this movie... If you don't like it, ignore it and move on with your life, capiche.

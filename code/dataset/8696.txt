This isn't anywhere near my genre, so LES MISERABLE was probably never going to blow my hair back. I've seen this on stage and I know the story - it's just that the songs aren't really my forte. Also, there was a lot of in-your-face hand-held camera-work, and that got old pretty quickly.

That said, I can wholeheartedly appreciate the skill herein on a technical level. Hugh Jackman felt right at home with the singing, and his voice is admirable. Crowe's no slouch, either. And the title of this thing pretty much describes what you're in for, so it's no dose of Prozac.

But Anne Hathaway's rendition of "I Dreamed A Dream" is worth the price of admission, even if it comes very early on in a 2-and-a-half hour movie. But have the tissues ready, because it is bloody heartbreaking.

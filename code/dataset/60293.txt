We all know the first Matrix was spectacular. The second was ok, since the final movie was going to be earth shattering. Unfortunately, Revolutions had no great twist, and nothing happened that was unexpected. A friend of mine and I have a bet, which trilogy would be better: Matrix or Lord of the Rings. He was/is a diehard Matrix fan. He conceded to me as soon as we walked of the theater. Dont worry WB, he said he was still going to buy the DVD.

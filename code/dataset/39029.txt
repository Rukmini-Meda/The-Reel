As a lover of disaster movies, this was a big let down. The special effects were excellent but the back stories and dialogue were disappointing to say the least. John Cusack is a very good actor but was totally wasted in this.

Most major disaster movies demand you to suspend belief a bit but this film took that to the extreme. Some of the films set pieces were so improbable as to be laughable.

Compared to higher quality disaster movies like Deep Impact and The Day After Tomorrow this comes across as laughably amateur. The ending like most films of its type is predictable and dull.

On the upside the scenes of destruction are well done and entertaining.

Overall I expected a lot more but there is enough entertainment (just) to merit further viewings.

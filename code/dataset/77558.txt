This movie WAS great!I don't know why people hate it so much!Of course I haven't seen the original 1981 version,and maybe it is much different,and that's why people don't like it,but in my opinion it is a great movie even if it is different.I like it because I love Greek mythology,and this movie has everything myths contain-an angry,evil god who tries to ruin everything other gods or heroes did well,a monster that needs to be defeated,a city that needs to be saved....It is a great example of a Greek myth-and the hero is Perseus, my favorite hero! I even like the actors-Sam Worthington,Liam Neeson,Ralph Fiennes...And although it contains a few violent and scary scenes,just in my opinion,children above the age of 12 years can watch it.I recommend Clash of the Titans,which is a great mythology-fantasy film, for every mythology or fantasy fan!Enjoy watching!

This is certainly in my top 10 films I have watched. I really like these types of films and this one had it all for me. There is a lot of twists and turns as well as a lot of action.

The plot is based around a family where the parents have separated and the mum has a new partner. There is a large earth quake where they live as well as other major disasters worldwide, they all have to try and survive, which takes them on an epic journey.

The plot is well planned and has a lot of variety which gives you the sense of a worldwide disaster, which is always good for this type of film. The graphics are good and there is a lot of action as well as on the edge of your seat moments.

I would 100% recommend.

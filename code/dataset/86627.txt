This movie is visually remarkable, but otherwise I can't give it much praise. The plot was one of the most predictable stories I've seen come out of Hollywood. There are some original ideas in terms of the world the story is set in, and the actors don't do a bad job with what they're given to work with, but I could see everything that happened next coming from a mile away, and I became more and more turned off as the movie progressed. After all the hype surrounding the release of this one, especially given the success of Cameron's previous productions, I left the theater with a really bad taste in my mouth.

I'm not saying don't watch it, because the visual imagery alone may make it worth watching, but don't expect a great screenplay.

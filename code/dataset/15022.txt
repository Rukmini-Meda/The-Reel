I have two main problems with this movie. Number one, I think we all know what this one is, Jar Jar. I don't think Jar Jar is bad in all scene, in fact, there are two scenes I actually genuinely find funny. Other than those, he just gets redundant and annoying, and just pointless. The second thing is the Trade Federation. They are trying to get the queen to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. There is no way to defend this, that is just plain stupid. I don't mind the politics, it's just the fact that the whole storyline is based on taxes and treaties and that crap. The overall storyline moves pretty fast and is relatively exciting. This movie has good effects (for the most part) and has really cool action scenes. There are some line deliveries that the respective actor kind-of butchered, it's not bad, the lines are just stale and dull. The only actors that applies to though are Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, but I think they do fine. I don't hate Jake Lloyd as young Anakin, I think he actually perfectly shows what would be a kid Darth Vader. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ray Parker all do fantastic in their roles. Ray Parker makes an excellent Darth Maul. I am also a big fan of Darth Maul. So, it is an exciting, and I would say good movie, it just has some dumb things sprinkled in their.

I am a 90's kid, and my parents grew up watching the original 1980's COTT, so when it was rereleased onto disc a few years ago, they bought it and showed it to me and my siblings. We thought it was the coolest thing ever, we absolutely LOVED it. When I saw the trailer for the 2010 remake of the film, I was very upset. I thought that the 1980's version was a timeless classic. I didn't need to be remade!! So I decided to dig up the original version and watch it again. At the time I hadn't watched it for 6 or 7 years, and when I had finished watching it I thought. "OK maybe it does need a remake." I won't go into extreme detail about the flaws in the story, and the over modernizing the movie with heavy metal soundtrack, and rapid editing shots. I will dive right into the things that really matter in a remake.

ACTING/RECASTING 6/10 Sam Worthington is a good actor, but as Perseus? Maybe not such a good choice. Liam Neeson is pretty much good cast in nearly any role, and the role of Zeus suit him fine.

SOUNDTRACK 5/10 The soundtrack for the movie did not fit with the movie. It didn't quite fit in with the ancient Greece theme. I guess that it worked OK because of the rapid editing and flashy colors.

EDITING/CGI 7/10 The animation is average for a film like this. The color in the film is very nice looking, however, to try to bring intensity into the film, they used shaky cam and rapid editing shots in all the action scenes, making them hard to follow.

OVERALL 6/10-or O.K

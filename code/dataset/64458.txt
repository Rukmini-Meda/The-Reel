2012,is an mind blowing piece.

Roland Emmerich known for making movies related to disasters does an excellent job.

The breaking of buildings,the separation of the highway and the whole view of New York City in vain has been shot excellently.

The only thing which I did not like was is its script.Its shoddy.

Roland Emmerich does an excellent job.Kudos to him.

The cinematographer does a very good job.

Performance wise-John Cusack is excellent.Amanda Peet is good.

Overall 2012 deserves a watch.

There is no doubt that 'Avatar' is a groundbreaking piece of cinema in terms of visual effects and cinematography. From the stunning landscapes and scenery to the design and appearance of the characters, 'Avatar' really is a visual feast and a pleasure to watch. One of the most visually spectacular films of all time.

It is, however, let down by its shallow and uninspiring storyline - a storyline that almost feels secondary to the CGI and special effects and struggles to justify the near 3 hour running length. That said, the flaws in the plot don't really take anything away from the enjoyment of this film, which is still a pleasure to watch.

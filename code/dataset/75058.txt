In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean, who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The decision changes their lives for ever.

The story works very well. From my point of view Tom Hooper took a high risk and won a big game. He did not chose easiest path to make this movie. Every actor sang and these performances recorded on the set. The best performance comes from Anna Hathaway. Her "I Dreamed a Dream" Hugh Jackman did also good job but. Russell Crowe's performance reminded a lot Johnny Depp's performance in Sweeney Todd film. They are not singers and that's why the movie suffers. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter brings a light elements to the story. Les Miserables is masterpiece which won't work for everybody. If you like musicals, watch this and enjoy.

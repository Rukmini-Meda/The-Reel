This movie was really amazing. I had never seen Russel Crowe in a movie before and I find he played this role perfectly. The suspense and mystery of his condition was an interesting part as well as the romance. I cried for sure in this movie and felt bad for him at times, but overall i really loved this movie and would definitely watch it again. I was really pleased by how they portrayed living with scizophrenia and how it is such a devestatingly sad condition to have in life. I recommend everyone watch it once because it has a good plot line and teaches us that even the most gifted have their downfalls and we need to keep on trying !!

 SLY is back and he brought his friends!!!! this film was all out action start to finish. there wasn't a part of this movie that sucked sly did something action fans have wanted to see in years and that's bring back the 80s. OK so I'm a fan-boy i admit it i loved the 80s movies action is done best when its over the top and full of cheesy one liners this movie has it all gun fights, car chases, over the top explosions a giant fighting a midget and enough one liners to shake a stick at. action at its all time best. so switch off your phone and grab a cold beer you wont regret it!!! oh and then get prepared for the expendables 2 because something tells me even more sh*t is gunna get blown up!!!

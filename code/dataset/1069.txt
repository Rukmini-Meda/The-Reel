Matrix 2 and 3 are to Matrix 1 exactly the same disaster as Highlander 2 and 3 to Highlander 1. I have only this theory: When the Wachowski Brothers did the Matrix, it was their first big budget movie and so they couldn't do what they want. The studio gave a mediocre script to a script doctor who rewrote the matrix into a superb modern action tale. And now, as the matrix was a blast, the wachowskis got totally creative freedom and now we know... they actually suck. Their executive producer or even Joel Silver personally would probably have done a better sequel.

Please Wachowski brothers, tell us who was really behind the making of the matrix 1, because that person could not possibly be the same as you poor losers!

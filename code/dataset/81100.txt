There is one scene in this movie that says it all: Perseus finds the annoying tin owl from the 1981 picture in a box of junk. He takes it in his hand, looks at it, and throws it back in the box while saying something like "We don't need this." Here, this production shows nothing but disdain towards the brilliant original production. This pretty much sums up what you have to expect from this "Clash of the Titans".

State of the art CGI stuff, but otherwise annoying and shallow characters that fulfill all the cliches you could possible think of. Good vs. evil at its simplest. The plot drags on without much suspension. This movie is once again proof, that fancy special effects alone don't make a good movie.

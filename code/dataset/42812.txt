 Sylvester, I can stand. Even Arnold, he's weirdly calm on screen. Acts like a T-100 even! But Lundgren, holy sh|t, that boy is annoying! And I'm German besides! A very good effort by the demolitions people, I also thought Willis was good as the CIA spook, this movie gave rise to RED and RED 2, apparently, two of my favorites along with Kill BIll. If you can get past the corny locker room jokes, you can watch it. Preferably while getting a decent BJ, makes it more tolerable. BOOM BOOM BOOM... Statham loves that cannon and she digs mine.

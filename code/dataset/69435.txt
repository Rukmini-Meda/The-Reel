It was very good.At the beginning it seems to be passion of heart and later transfigures into a drama Alfred Hitchcock tried to establish. Suspense and excitement, the old film noir and modern crime.Representing a journey that you will never forget. Mario puzos novel was greatly applied by Brando,Pacino and the whole cast.Likedit sincerely.Motivated me to be a film lover.

 This is the first time I've seen a movie twice in the cinema ! All character , story , music , lyrics ,... is outstanding . Based on the classic novel of Victor Hugo , so this movie cant have any mistake in story . But not the story touch me the most , I love this because the thinking about dark and light , lie and true , how people treat the others, . In this movie , I don't see anyone is a villain , even Javert , all I see is in war , the only one hurt is the innocent person : the people , student and the soldier . So we have to find something to believe , to live for and try to not hurt anyone in your pursuit of happiness . And all of it, the music and lyrics are awesome , beautiful and touching , I have to confess that in the end of this beautiful movie , I couldn't hold my tears any longer , I cried in the cinema , twice  The point is , you have to see this movie if you want to know how much freedom cost !

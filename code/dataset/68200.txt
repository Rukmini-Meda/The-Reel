Copolla directed a film that holds you from the beginning to the end with the merits of the excellent work of Mario Puzo, and an excellent performance of almost everyone in the cast, especially Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. In my opinion is the best of the trilogy and a movie that should be on the list of those who haven't seen.

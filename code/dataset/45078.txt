--- SPOILER ALARM --- In the end they find out that about the half of Africa is still there. And they go there, obviously because they want to land there.

Unfortunately that's the end of the movie ...

I would like to see the movie about them landing in Africa. And probably the Africans would have given those "immigrants", those extra mouths to feed the finger.

And then we would have found out that at least half the passengers are military staff and at least half the cargo is arms and ammo. And then heroic and pure Americans would have invaded Africa.

But such bitter reality is not for the Americans ... So Roland is not going to make THAT movie.

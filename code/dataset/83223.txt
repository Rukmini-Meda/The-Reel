The mortal son of the god Zeus embarks on a perilous journey to stop the underworld and its minions from spreading their evil to Earth as well as the heavens.

I am one of those who has not seen the original... yet. But this film has been raved, with bad reviews. I actually really enjoyed this film, but I understand where everybody's coming at. The action is really spot on, especially the fight against the giant scorpions. But then that's really what the film gives you; action and nothing more. I saw this weeks after it came out into theaters in 3D. The 3D was absolutely horrid. Nothing else really to say about this film. The action was great, the 3D was horrible, and everything else was okay. OKAY. The film was okay. 6/10.

Wonderful movie. It made me feel special just from the first minute till the end. After movie I wondered if I can do something like these guys did - thefts, kidnappings and all that kind of dirty stuff. The film perfectly conveys the atmosphere - dark and ominous New York, and a sunny, but mysterious Italy. Top rated move.

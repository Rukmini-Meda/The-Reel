 Roland Emmerich's 2012 is the complete choice for the absolute worst movie of 2009 because of the boring premise that tries to tell us that the 2012 doomsday that was supposed to happen wasn't and we already know that that it happened more than 1 year ago. When Roland Emmerich did The Patriot in 2000 I completely enjoyed it and hailed it as the best colonial movie ever made and this just leaves me with one question what was he thinking while making this true piece of crap. Think about this you have a good cast such as John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Danny Glover embarrassing themselves in this completely boring disaster flick and made me want to fall asleep while watching it and I never want to see it ever again in my life.

 Seems to me they just took the story of Noah out of the Bible and added modern technology to it. Failed civilization. Warnings that are not believed. Selection of survivors. Water over the tops of mountains. Ark. All that is missing is the rain, the waters of the deep sure did open up. Actually, the Bible is a lot better. The CGI here is OK, direction is marginal, music is weak. Be sure to avoid the music at the end, it is just trash. How they ever decided to include that song is way beyond me. The movie's dramatic moments are predictable and weak. Some actions by characters are just stupid. There are massive plot holes; why, for instance, would rich people be able to buy a seat in the ark when money will be useless? Why did people stay behind for no apparent reason? The movie sure makes the point of the necessity for God sealing the doors of the ark, and not humans. All in all, a waste of time. Your time would be better spent reading the Bible and the story of Noah and not seeing this tripe.

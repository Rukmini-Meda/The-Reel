The apocalypse is coming and it is going to hit Earth in 2012. The ancient Mayan calendar predicts this apocalypse and some researchers do what they can in order to survive this event.

I remember people talking about the end of time once this movie was about to hit theaters and I find it amusing how much a movie can affect people. I'm not a believer of all the predictions of the apocalypse but I find the theories interesting.

This movie was not amazing but the special effects and scenes were top notch. Great acting, great plot and fantastic visual effects. Also I loved the concept of the movie.

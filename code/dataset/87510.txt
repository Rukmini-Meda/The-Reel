This film chronicles the life of American mathematician John Nash, a genius considered one of the most remarkable mathematicians of the twentieth century. I confess I did not know him until I saw the film, but I found it interesting how he tells his life, using his life's adventures to make the story more appealing to the public. Not everything the film shows is exactly true but if we except the writer's creative and narrative freedoms, the film is close enough to reality for a biopic. Russel Crowe plays the protagonist, and he does it in a generally good way. The big problem of his interpretation was the strange and somewhat forced accent he used, and that I confess I did not understand.

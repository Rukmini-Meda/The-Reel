 ?t's an outstanding movie.its awesome to see Chuck Norris in theaters. And his scenes were super and surprising. Sylvester Stallone is still in form and ready to kill all of his enemies. It is good to see Jean Claude Van Damme in this movie. He plays the bad guy role well. You hate him when he kills the young guy from Barney's team.Jason Statham is classy again in this movie. Gunner(Dolph Lundgren) makes us laugh in the mine's scene when he tries to blow the mine but he fails. But it was disappointing that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Jet appears shortly in the movie.. Finally we are looking forward to watch the 3rd movie.

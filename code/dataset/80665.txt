Just like my rating. This movie are excellent and perfect. I don't like sci-fi and action movie at all (usually). But i felt different for this movie. When i saw this movie at the beginning, i felt like "oh this movie will be great". I do love romance movie but this is the first action/sci-fi movie i've ever watched with all my heart and i gave 10 on my ratings. Seriously.

First. This is James Cameron movie. No doubt, it will be great. And he prove it. The cast oh my god, so perfect. I mean really perfect. Their acting are not too much, but made us felt if we were inside the movie and the situation. This movie use a lot of scientific language but magically, i understand that. And the conflict, wonderful. The plot sounds good. But when i watched it, it was really great. i've got a lot of emotion when i watched it. I've got a love story, family conflict, threatened world, and effort to save the world in this lovely movie. I mean, this is a whole package movie. I love it!

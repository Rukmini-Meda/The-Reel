To be honest, I hated this movie. Maybe it was the fact that our band director forced us to watch it in band. Anyway, the acting, in my opinion, was nothing more than bad. Pacing was terrible. I just could not keep focused, it was so boring. It's like one of those movies you had to watch in music class in elementary school multiple times. Just a bitter story about someone most people don't care about. Only difference is I only had to sit through it once.

Terminator came out in the same year. Terminator. And yet this won the Oscar for best picture. I sill fail to understand why. Someone please explain.

In short; Never watch it. The only memorable part is the creepy, gay laugh.

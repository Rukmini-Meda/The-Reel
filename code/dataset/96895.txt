This film is beautifully shot, with some of the best CGI effects(which can be done very badly). however, this film does use almost every cliche in the book, culminating in some very annoying, unlikeable characters, and a very cheesy villain who does not fit in with the film. quite frankly, this movie takes itself far to seriously for anyone to gain any enjoyment out of a 3 hour runtime. the plot is derivative to say the least, and I predicted the ending literally the first time I saw the Na'vi, who are basically offensive native American stereotypes. however, there is still some fun to be had with the amazing cinematography and decent action. this is by no means the worst movie ever made, but the cliches and 3hr runtime are very hard to stomach

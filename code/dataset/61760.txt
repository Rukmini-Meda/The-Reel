The Godfather is a film of undeniable triumph; everything from the set to the sound and lighting, the score to the amazing cast, is perfect and Francis Ford Coppola's vision does justice to Mario Puzo's stylish crime novel, with the author partnering with Coppola on the screenplay. The film is a masterpiece of acting and direction, with Coppola's influence clear, and the work of stars such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall centre-stage in a beautifully dark and corrupt tale of a powerful Italian crime family. Never has the Mafia been better depicted in cinema, and I opine never will it be again.

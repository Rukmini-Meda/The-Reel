James Cameron has created yet another masterpiece. Jaw dropping special effects matched with incredible performances make up Avatar.

A paraplegic ex-marine, Jake Sully, takes over for his murdered twin brother in a project known as the Avatar Program, which was designed to communicate with the native humanoids (Na'vi) that inhabit a life- supporting moon six years away. The advanced technology allows his consciousness to be transferred to another body, where he can finally walk once again.

Jake participates in several missions lead by Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), an expert on the Na'vi. Within months, he begins to question the actions of the humans in charge and is faced with a difficult decision.

Zoe Saldana's performance of Neytiri, a Na'Vi who Jake befriends, was extraordinary. It was a surprise that she was not nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe. In order to portray such a character, she had to have the right facial expressions and speaking talents, which she nailed.

Supporting characters such as Mo'at (CCH Pounder), Grace Augustine and Miles Quarich (Stephen Lang) were also brilliantly acted.

The effects were just as stunning as Zoe Saldana's performance. Alien creatures and plants alike looked real, were they all had been computerized, as well as the Na'vi, which were created using motion capture.

In the end, the excellent writing and directing conducted by James Cameron will make Avatar difficult to forget.

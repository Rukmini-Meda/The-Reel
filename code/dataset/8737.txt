 Wonderful movie that pokes insight and humor at Amadeus Mozart. It's a trip back into a historic time. A brilliant yet improper genius who hears and feels the music created inside of himself. Amadeus is excellently portrayed by Tom Hulce, as a bawdy conceited genius, with fabulous acting. The movie features dramatic renditions of Mozarts most popular compositions. The great court composer Salieri recognizes the raw talent and despised Mozarts frivolity. Salieri used his influence to try and suppress Mozart and make the spotlight his own. The sets are beautiful and detailed with great period costumes. Amazing score and cinema photography. True suspense and drama.

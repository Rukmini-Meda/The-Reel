 as an action movie this piece of nostalgia is a must see, you have some of the biggest names in action cinema teaming up including 'Stallone' 'schwarzenneger' 'lundgren', and some of the newer generation 'statham' 'li' and 'steve Austin', not to mention a cool cameo from Bruce Willis. now the action here is big, loud and brutal and the movie never lets up from start to finish, its the best movie Stallone has made for years, and is sure to do wonders for the careers of everybody in it, i cannot wait for the second one. now the movie isn't perfect and the acting isn't some of the greatest, but bieng a movie full of action heroes did you expect it to be, but as a action movie this is a must see piece of action cinema

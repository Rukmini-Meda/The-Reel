I really enjoyed this movie, and I really don't get what people have against it. It is interesting, funny, full of action, and has (in my opinion) best lightsaber duel of Star Wars saga (Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan against Darth Maul). I really loved Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman in this movie. I am just disappointed that Darth Maul was killed, I mean yes they returned him in Clone Wars, nut I hoped for more of him in the prequels. Besides that, movie was great. I really loved planet of Naboo, it really looked magnificent. For me, this is the best Star Wars movie, and my favourite movie of all time, and I am huge fan of movies like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Donnie Drako, Indiana Jones, American Pie, Liberal Arts, 21 Jump Street, The Jungle Book etc. Overall, 10/10 for me.

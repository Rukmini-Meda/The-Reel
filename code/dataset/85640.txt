I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites. The actors gave these characters special meanings and helped to make the "criminals" more "likable" in my opinion. This movie is one of my "go to" choices when I am looking for something more familiar to watch and I honestly can view it every view days with no problem. If you are looking for a "mafia" movie that also spends time showing some of the family connections, than this movie is for you.

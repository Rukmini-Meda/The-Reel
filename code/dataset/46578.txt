I ended up watching 2012 on the small screen, although I regretted not having watched it on the big screen when it came out originally.

2012 will most likely not make you cry, or stun you with the most unforgettable performances you ever saw. However, the acting was sill more than decent, and the story kept evolving with time, but the true highlight of 2012 is the amazing visual spectacles.

The visuals in this movie are nothing short of astonishing, and as someone who watched just about every disaster movie out there, I can say that 2012 takes it to the next level, by delivering disaster scenes that will ASTOUND you with their realism.

The scenes are SO detailed and so realistic that if you were to watch such scenes as part of the evening news, you would have found them totally believable.

Some moments in fact were quite intense, even shocking (in an entertaining kind of way), which was all part of the experience.

There is no question that 2012's depiction of disaster is an astonishing accomplishment in film history and as such is a must watch (assuming that you like this kind of stuff, of course). The movie has a fight for survival story-line, delivers some nice action scenes, a lot of drama, a good number of intense experience moments, and even several emotionally charged moments which all in all make 2012 worthy of watching. You are guaranteed some exquisite visual cinematic moments that are rarely encountered if ever on the big (or small) screen.

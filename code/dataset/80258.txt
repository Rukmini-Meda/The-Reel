LMAO!!!!! Are you some kind of boring 90 year old man????? This has to be the worst review I think I've read on here and I've read a few! You're moaning about Close Calls???? IT'S CALLED GOD DAMN TENSION IT WAS THE WHOLE FUN OF IT! It kept you in the edge of your seat! Every bloody film has CLOSE CALLS. James Bond is probably the ultimate one which abuses this to the MAX yet it is fantastic! If this was meant to be REALISTIC as you think it should have been. Then they wouldn't have made it off the bloody runway and then they'd be a completely blank film without the main characters.

Flippen hell you must be the worst person to see a film with. My opinion on this film wasn't the best of story lines, but the Director said himself in many interviews that he didn't want this film to be deadly serious, he just wanted to deliver entertainment and to just bring a bit of humour to the situation otherwise it'll be quite a depressing film. Might as well call it Shindlers List 2 or whatever.

I found it extremely entertaining and I got my money's worth out of it. There was a lot of character development but it isn't Batman you're watching here it's the end of the world lol.

I went thru nearly every emotion. Happy, Sad, Terrified, Anger. No other film has made me go through so many emotions and those films are supposed to be called "Epic and Memorable"

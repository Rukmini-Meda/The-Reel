It talks about maths, love & schizophrenia. And these themselves are the chief reasons to grab a DVD of this movie which sees Russel Crowe in his best.

A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie indeed which is a story of many years in the life of the brilliant theorist. The storytelling is very good, with ample implications to create the thrills. Music is fine as is the screenplay. Cinematography is terrific. Not to mention, Jennifer Connelly is perfectly in her character throughout. Ed Harris & Christopher Plummer behave nice as well.

A certain level of ennui is induced towards the middle, as it is set in a wide time-lapse. The suspense stays and eventually the viewer is treated not without revelation, but with dissolve. Brilliant! The climax is sure to create goosebumps.

BOTTOM LINE: An 8.4 out of 10 for a very effective effort.

Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES

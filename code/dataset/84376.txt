As a fan of both the book and of the original play, this movie is the best combo of both.

it is basically the play if it was to have more of the story-line from the book.

LOVED IT!

That book is the greatest I have ever read, so the adding of more content in the form of the play (Which is a masterpiece of it's own) was a pleasure!

and the direction and the performances were amazing as well.

Summery: Great adaptation.

I found this better than the second Matrix film ("Reloaded") but not anywhere as intriguing as the first film. Perhaps they shouldn't have made ANY sequels.

Once again you have the same problems: too much verbiage that you can't make sense of, and too much violence. Regarding all the techno-talk, what good is it if you audience doesn't understand what's going on and are lost most of the time?

After awhile, frankly, especially with the unlikable lead characters, I didn't care what happened. As I said in the second movie's review, they should have made just one tremendous Matrix movie, even if it were an hour longer. The sequels did nothing to enhance the legacy of that film.

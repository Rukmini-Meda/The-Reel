 It's a shame to review this movie so terribly, because there are things about the film that were done quite nice: the artistic direction, from the costume, the animated creatures, the digital mattes. All quite superb. But, the script is so bad that none of that can be overlooked while trying to enjoy the picture. The original 1981 film didn't have a fabulous script either, but it was head and shoulders above this. And the effects in that film, even by Ray Harryhousen's standards, were a bit rough. But it made for a much more enjoyable evening. I don't think the actors can be judged, because the lines they were given no one could deliver. It does all come down to the script. Or some over zealous producer demanding scenes and plots get added. If anyone has ever seen Kevin Smith's story about working on a script for Superman and the producer kept saying, "yeah, cool. But, can we add a giant spider in there somehow?". That's what I was reminded of the whole time watching this. Terrible.

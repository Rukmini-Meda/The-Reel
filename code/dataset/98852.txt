This movie is poor. It is so out of line with the original trilogy from the beginning the opening scene like 75% is really boring and the title crawl should make fascinated to see what happens but in this movie it leaves you confused. Some of the CG worlds are cool but you can't develop characters from 12 different worlds. Jar Jar Binks drives me round the bend and it is quiet long. Padme is so plain and boring and you really couldn't care less if she died or not Obi Wan and Qui gon have good chemistry it is a shame that Qui GOn dies. Darth Maul has potential to bve a massively cool villain but they give him no character time and I think he is just there for the awesome duel at the end. Jake Lloyd is very annoying and the pod racing isn't exciting because you don't care about any of the characters. Overall boring with 1 cool scene.

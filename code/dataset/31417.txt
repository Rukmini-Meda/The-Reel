The Expendables the perfect to watch with a couple of your mates after a long night of drinking gawking at the pretty colours of a Nintendo game because seriously this movie starts off within the first 5 minutes a guys gets his top half blown off of his legs.

The other problem that I had with the movie (make one of the other problems) is that I didn't understand a word these guys were saying until I turned on the subtitles and even that was a stretch because I thought it was going to have (mumbling) at the bottom of the screen when Sylvester Stallone started talking.

Also who the hell where the people actors in this movie I could understand who Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis were but that was it I mean if you are going to have a movie that has amazing action heroes include references or actors like Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford or Chuck Norris that show up the whole movie not for 10 minutes and not wait till the third film for some of them.

But I still say if you like a movie where you can poke fun at it for being terrible then this is it my friends. My friends joked around and said that they couldn't have the CSI theme because they wasted all their budget on two minutes of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the same scene.

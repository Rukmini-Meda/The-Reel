 Bunch of old guys and lame attempts at humour (yes the English spelling). Makes Jason Statham look like an actor compared to the rest. Feeble and far, far too reliant on effects even for an action movie. Dolt Lundgren!! - only missing Jean Claude Van Dumb; Chuck Nowits and of course Steven Seagull for the full line-up of talentless; monosyllabic dim wits. Thinks it's witty but absolutely nowhere near Die Hard or Terminator - not as funny as Predator even. As for plot and dialogue - knocked out by a three year old in five minutes. I know the film is a joke riffing on past glories (!) but it is just lame. The jokes barely deserve the name, most of the action scenes are in the dark so you can't make out the old guys lumbering around. I would put in a spoiler but there is nothing in the plot to spoil. Lazy, self indulgent dross.

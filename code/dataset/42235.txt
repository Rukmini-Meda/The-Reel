"The Expendables" is a nice little movie that unites an ensemble cast of old school action stars of the past few decades. Names like Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and then some show up.

This movie has all the ingredients to make an action movie: tough and bad ass macho men as our main leads who hardly take a bullet, cool and exiting action that never lets up, exotic locations and more emphasis on action than on plot and character just like an old school 80s action movie.

The plot is pretty cliche and all the characters are one dimensional stereotypes not to mention some of the motives don't make sense especially towards the climax but in the end its a lot of fun watching old school action stars still kicking ass after the 80s have been over with for a long time.

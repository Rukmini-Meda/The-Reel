 Watching this movie has been one of the most emotional experiences of my life. I slightly knew about it through middle school chorus and slight mentions of it in the dinner table. I knew this was going to be a good movie when I saw the trailer on TV. It was a musical and Anne Hathaway starred in it, I couldn't pass this up. After seeing the movie, I was in awe. I felt like I was in France, experiencing what the characters are going through. The movie felt so natural and it wasn't like any other musical I've seen. Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar 100% and I was mad that Hugh Jackman didn't win for best actor and the film for best picture. I thought they deserved it fair and square. And the Oscar performance from the les mis cast was beautiful. It was so nice to see everyone together! What I really loved about the film is the chemistry between everyone. Though Valjean and Javert played cat and mouse with each other, they are best friends off screen. I also heard that the girl cast members would sing karaoke when they were not filming. I felt the connection. It was real. I didn't mind that most of the dialogue is sung. I have to say that I cringed at some moments (sorry guys), but it gives it more of a natural feel. The acting is spot on. I easily felt the emotion the characters gave off, which was why I felt like I was in 1800's France. I also realized there was a Broadway musical and a couple of concerts along with a book (yes they all came before the movie, but I had no clue until after I've seen the film). I have not read the book yet (it's over 1000 pages!), but I have seen it on Broadway and seen the concert (even the one with Nick Jonas, which I LOVED --> I was a Jonas Brothers fan back in the day). I loved them all. It's a beautiful, yet sad story and YOU should find a way to watch this through the film or Broadway musical. It's 24601% worth it!

Greetings from Lithuania.

"A Beautiful Mind" (2001) is a must see picture to everyone who appreciates great quality dramas. Based on the life of John Nash, it tells a story of love, illness and life itself. Played magnificently by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, this is a superbly crafted movie, terrifically paced and very emotional and touching. R.Crowe should have won Oscar for this performance, as good as Denzel Washington was in "Training Day" - John Nash isn't Det. Alonzo Harris - these are very different movies, and i think that R.Crowe was a definite winner.

Nevertheless, "A Beautiful Mind" is beautiful movie, inspiring and touching. If somehow you missed it - you should definitely see it if you like great quality movies.

 Superb movie. I saw the Broadway show. Loved it. Loved the music. I have the CD's. I know it pretty much by heart now. I also have other film versions of Hugo's masterpiece, but they are not musicals. This film version tops them all. It even helped me understand a few things not obvious in other versions. Anne Hathaway as Fantine is so, so good - her interpretation of 'I Dreamed a Dream' became a classic the second I saw it. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is excellent and very believable. Eddie Redmayne is a very good Marius and seems so sincere - his role became more important to me than in previous versions of plays or films. Russell Crowe as Javert is not that good though. That is not his element it seems; he is not bad, just a bit too ordinary. The Thenardiers are funny, a bit over the edge though, but it helps keeping the movie from being too 'serious'. Surprising role for Helena Bonham Carter, but she is very good. Is was a very nice gesture to have Colm Wilkinson as Bishop of Digne since he played Jean Valjean so often on Broadway and West End versions of the play. True to the original story. Better than the Broadway show even, I must say. Must see, large screen if you can.

After reading countless scathing reviews of this title, I was interested to see for myself the highly criticised rehash of the 1980s flop, and was subsequently surprised. It is certainly true that Sam Worthington could have made a far more convincing Perseus, and that this film did not really stay true to the strangely touching qualities of Greek Mythology, but as for actors, I have certainly seen worse.

Although wooden, it certainly tried to be historically accurate, and, to a reasonable extent, succeeded. The supporting cast were also impressive, and the soundtrack, while not exceptional, was suitably 'epic'. Liam Neeson and Gemma Arterton should both be proud of excellent performances.

This was certainly not a great film, but neither was it as bad as most critics seem to think it was. Not by a long shot.

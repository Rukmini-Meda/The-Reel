 I would give this a 7.8 out of ten, but decided to round down. The characters are pretty good. Adrian Helmsly is easily the best. Charlie is enjoyable and the roles of Sasha, Jackson, and Adrian's friend there who I can't remember the name of. Then again, Jackson's kid Noah isn't that appealing to me and I feel like Anhueser's villainy is kind of forced. Beginning with the good, I was fairly moved by the scenes showing the deaths of the masses and felt like the whole issue is pretty interesting. The storyline was okay I guess, but sometimes I felt like things such as Jackson's strained relationship with his family detracted. The whole thing is a pretty good example of how human greed corrupts the world and how money is far too powerful a force in determining peoples' fate. Lastly, I think anyone in the mood for some weird humor should YouTube Charlie's apocalypse video because it's pretty entertaining. On the bad side, it's pretty predictable throughout. Gordon making three implausible takeoffs gets old, and you pretty much know that the Curtis family will all get back together by the end from early on. You can definitely see the same personality in this as in Independece Day, which is one of my personal least favorites apart from the performances of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Another annoying aspect of the film is how Jackson and whoever happens to be in the same vehicle as him manage to survive everything. I estimated that he and his family should have died about thirty-five times all total. So in a way, I'm kind of surprised at how much I actually like this movie, because I can't really find a whole lot to like about it. For anyone considering watching it, it's good if you want something emotional or something that is easy to laugh at when there is no intent of humor.

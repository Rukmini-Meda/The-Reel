 The beautiful mind is a story about a mathematics genius. I can say that the power of human mind to solve a complex problem is described in great detail in this movie. Every time I watch this movie I think about how a scientist solves a problem that is beyond the reach of any ordinary people. The intellectual ability of John Nash is outstanding. The way he solved the problem of game theory is very effectively shown in the movie.The director gets full credit for depicting such a complex personality in such sensible manner.I personally recommend this movie to any one who has some interest in mathematical problems.It is surely a great piece of work,worth watching many times. Russell Crowe in the role of John Nash is brilliant.

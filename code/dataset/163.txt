I have the health condition of clinical depression and anxiety by being bipolar with schizophrenia added to the mix. I say it's a curse because I don't handle everyday pressures from work, stress, marriage.. life well at all. The accumulation of it builds up and I repress it, in denial. It has cost me my job, home, wife, friends, etc. Little did I know 90% of marriages end in divorce with one partner that is bipolar. I'd wake up every morning with terrible stomach problems not even realizing it was anxiety. I guess as a man you just suck it up, but it caught up with me as work became more demanding. Thankfully with the help of medication it is managed somewhat although it makes me lethargic, tired, have memory/concentration issues, and not be as coordinated.

Thing is, it is also a gift. Without sounding like a prideful person I am very intelligent. Certain things just come easy to me. Definitely not mathematics, like the movie, but in using logic, reason, and discernment. Thinking deeply on matters. I take any negativity in my life and try to flip it into something positive, using humor or finding a solution, a way around it mentally. Anyways, thanks for reading my post. Good luck to you if you are battling any health or family issues in your life. We all are it seems.

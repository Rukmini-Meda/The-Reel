"Clash of the Titans" could have been so much better. And as with many movies today, the problem was the length. This was way too short to make sense. The characters were one-dimensional, there was little-to-no backstory developed. There were plot holes you could drive a truck through. The visual effects, though life-like and well blended with the live action material, came at you way too fast. It was hard to keep track of who was dying, what just got destroyed, and which characters were where in the scene.

This movie is a prime example of why Avatar haters are wrong. This movie had everything Avatar had, 3D effects, lots of CGI, Sam Worthington, you name it. This movie falls unbelievably flat, and wasn't worth the price of the DVD. Hate James Cameron all you want, the man knows how to make a movie, and it is clear he had nothing to do with this one.

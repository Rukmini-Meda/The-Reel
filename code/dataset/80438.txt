 I do not agree with other reviewers.although the cast and acting of Sam Worthington and some others is not that best but still this is a great fantasy movie with giant scorpions,medusa,crack-en and ghosts. I loved Clash of the Titans. If clash of the titans has billion fans i am one o them. If clash of the titans has one fan I'm the one. If it has no fan actually i have no existent. This is an epic battle between underworld and Perseus. It would never have been a box office bomb. My 2nd favorite movie after lord of the rings and the hobbits.The sequel Wrath of the Titans wasn't that great like first one.I would love to see remake of second movie and more sequels with better action and 3d costumes

Story/Plot - A war between Zeus and Hades is about to embark. Hades leader of the underworld is intent on toppling his brother Zeus. However he doesn't see the mortal son of Zeus, Perseus getting in the way of his plans. Hades summons the monster known as the Kraken to destroy the city of Argos. Perseus a half god is thrown into battle and takes on the challenge to save Argos.

My verdict - A heart warming story of love and war, complimented by plenty of action. I enjoyed this film but found myself wanting more from it. I have sat here trying to think of what to write for this review but am struggling to find more so I apologise if this is short.

Although the movie was released some time ago I have only recently discovered it.

I must say, very disappointing in terms of the historic accuracy after reading various transcripts of his life. I acknowledge the acting and costumes were very good, however the (unconfirmed) annoying laugh of Mozart and reference to his toilet habits I found really annoying, as was the length of the movie.

My score of 6 was entirely for the costumes, overall acting and the music. I apologize if my review upsets some readers, but unfortunately I wasn't very impressed given the lack historical evidence.

 This movie was one of the best movies I've ever watched. Great Cast, Great Plot, Great Directing, everything was great. In fact I think I watched it like 20 times and now I've memorized it. Really moving and great. At first I didn't know It was a musical but when I saw it, I was like "WOW"! I think this movie's way better than that Titanic Movie. It was great and moving but I think this movie deserved those Academy awards titanic won ,too. I think that this movie should be in the top rated ones, too I mean it really teaches you so many things, in fact it taught me so many things because well I'm 15 and it really makes a lot of sense to me and makes me realize so many things. I really liked the role of Javert played by Russell Crowe, one of the greatest actors ever. It was a moving character and I really wanted to read the novel and had in mind of watching the film and out of nowhere once I watched it and for 2 days I couldn't watch anything else. This happened to me with The Godfather, The Dark Knight and Gladiator and also A Beautiful mind and L.A. Confidential. I highly recommend people who haven't seen this movie yet to watch it.

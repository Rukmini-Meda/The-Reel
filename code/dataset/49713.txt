Alright, I've been putting off this review just because this movie is just so damn bad. Before I watched this movie I thought "I like action movies, and destruction movies. Also the cast is decent." So already I wasn't expecting much but what I got was enough to start a real apocalypse.

The movie starts off alright, not great, not even good. In fact it starts out like every other destruction movie ever made. I thought that was fine, there's not many ways to start a movie like this. But come to find out that the entire movie follows the same formula. That formula, if you haven't guessed, is "what did another apocalypse movie do? Oh okay lets do that." The fact is, this movie has absolutely nothing new to bring to the table AT ALL. It takes every little trope from every other action movie ever made. There is literally no new content here at all.

So after the copy and paste plot, action scenes, and tropes, I start wondering why this movie was ever made. And it is simply to cash in on the popular 2012 theme going on right now and nothing else. This is one of those movies that i'd like to punch the writers in the face for making it. Not only is the entire movie predictable, but it's just stupid. I know John Cusack can act but he doesn't seem to care enough anymore. Probably because he knew how bad this movie was but realized he hasn't been in anything in a while and needed to stay relevant.

The ONLY 2 reason this movie doesn't have a perfectly bad score of a 1 is because frankly Netflix exists and the level of awful for movies has been taken to new heights. Secondly I was kind of entertained enough to keep watching even if it was just because I was thinking "So what trope are they going to use next... oh that one, okay." Also I like watching people die.

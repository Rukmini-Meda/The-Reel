The Trade Federation has a blockade against the planet Naboo. The Republic sends Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate an end. However, Sith Lord Darth Sidious orders the Federation to attack. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan encounter Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks on Naboo. They rescue Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Their ship is forced to land on the planet Tatooine where they meet slave child Anakin Skywalker.

The general assessment is that this is a CGI masterpiece but there are many problems. Even its' biggest detractors can't deny that this movie has revolutionary CGI. It is a wonderland of computer magic. On the other hand, the acting is pretty bad even without Jar Jar. The exception is Liam Neeson. The man is an acting beast. Ewan McGregor is fine but Natalie Portman is lost. I have nothing against Jake Lloyd. The kid is expected to be too much and he can't deliver.

Jar Jar is horrible. The Gungan leader is even worst. It is a poor gamble from the start but then it gets worst. The kiddie humor is all Lucas and it's all bad. Lucas has absolute power and he uses it to aim this at the younglings. Even in the terrific pod race, the kiddie humor infects the thrills. The humor is bad. On the opposite end, the good is the villain Darth Maul. He's a cool character. However, even that is done wrong in the end when both Darth Maul and Qui-Gon are gone from the prequels. By far, they are the best characters and Lucas sends them packing early in the prequel trilogy.

Then there is the force. I never needed it to be explained. That's why the midi-chlorians are so awkward. None of that is needed. There is also the immaculate conception which is even more awkward. One can get inspiration from religion but Lucas shouldn't have copied from religion. There is also a general lack of tension throughout the movie. The expositions and conversations are stale. This is a minor disappointment.

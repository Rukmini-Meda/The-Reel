I absolutely liked watching this film because of the wonderful actress and talented actor. I like this movie because of the developed love connection between the main actor and the actress. I admire the scriptwriters because the story seemed have a lot of intellectual background behind the script. I always like college themed films because they inspire me to study more, college themed films are also good because they can also inspire younger students to learn and study what they want to learn and perfect their skills and someday pass down their knowledge to younger generations. To me this film is amazing because it seemed to be made with an untraditional story, meaning there did not seem to be a hero or villain, (protagonist or antagonist); the film was about learning to grow with close friends to reach a better place. I also admire this film because of it's great main movie stars casting in a film drama, instead of the expensive crew production style blockbuster films. This means that great drama films can be made these days without the need of tons of fireworks. The film inspired me to keep wanting to be smart.

Gemma Arterton also starred in another fantasy movie in 2010... that being Clash of the Titans. In Prince of Persia she played a Princess who was charged with a sacred mission by the gods. In Clash of the Titans she plays Io, Io in Clash of the Titans is the protector of Perseus. Io, according to the movie, rebuffed the advances of an unknown god and was cursed with immortality.

Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Danae (Tine Stapelfeldt). Danae was tricked by Zeus as he was disguised as Danae's husband, Calibos (Jason Flemyng). Calibos is enraged that his wife is impregnated by Zeus and kills Danae and her child... well he tries to kill the child. Perseus survives. Calibos is hit with a lightning bolt as he attempts to toss Danae's casket into the sea. The lightning bolt disfigures him.

I know I say this a lot, and I mean it a lot, I really like this movie. Although, the creative license that the writers have utilized in creating Clash of the Titans has been pretty extreme. Don't believe me. Look up Io or Perseus or any of the other characters online. The way their lives are depicted in Clash of the Titans is pretty different than what the ancient Greeks believed. Fortunately for the writers, these characters are made up... so they can use as much creative license as they was in order to make the kind of movie they want.

I liked a lot of the fighting scenes. Especially the scene when Perseus and his fellow travelers are fighting Medusa. Perseus is successful in chopping her head off which was his mission to begin with. However, it cost him his companions... including Io, who he had begun to fall in love with. And the bitch of it was... she loved him also.

Because I love mythology and everything that goes along with it I loved this movie. It didn't hurt that Gemma Arterton was in it... she is quite beautiful. I give this movie 10 stars out of 10

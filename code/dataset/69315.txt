 I won't go on and on about the MANY things wrong with this movie. A couple typical examples will suffice. In no particular order, a large airplane takes off from LAX just ahead of an crumbling runway. The plane then travels all the way to downtown LA, a distance of a good ten miles and flies between falling skyscrapers. Considering the tallest building in LA is just over 1000 feet tall, you mean to say the plane traveled all that way and is STILL under 1000 feet in the air? Another example, all infrastructure has been destroyed... yet there they are, fall out to sea in an airplane... and their cell phones still work. One more, the Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012, yet while things were pretty messed up by the finish of the movie, the world hadn't really ended. And finally, there were all these arks constructed in a huge cavern, also constructed and it was all accomplished in under three years. That in itself is nor very realistic. But what really takes the cake is that these huge vessels, which are constructed to withstand practically ANYTHING, yet a few rocks fall from the ceiling and practically destroy one. WTF?!

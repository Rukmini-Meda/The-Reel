Avatar is story about planet Pandora which is inhabited by intelligent aliens. These Aliens are more close to their mother Planet from anything else in a supernatural way. They are not advanced in terms of technology (yeah that's what we call on earth). Humans arrive on this planet to search of an element precious to them in terms of money. They have 'Avatar's' built which copy genome of these aliens. They look like aliens but have mind of a human. Avatar's are built to build relations with natural habitat on Pandora. One of the Avatar's gets too close to these aliens and joins them to protect their planet from arrived humans.

Pros: Awesome natural visuals belonging to other planet. The seven words that u just read cover up for every con. Idea of overlapped connection.. i mean creating a altogether different creature in appearance(Avatar). Special bonding via Connection of typical organ. The connection bundles into tremendous energy when every being on planet kind of meditates in front of sacred tree. The scene in which they surround the sacred tree and meditate is tremendous. Finally Mother Nature defending itself literally rushes ones adrenalin high. The elements like sacred flower, respect to the prey and ceremony to say bye to deceased ones add to the natural element.

Cons: Human race is shown too negative, if this were the case I doubt they could have survived elsewhere. The set up in which Avatar gets active should have bought up with more restrictions, I mean the entire body was made available for locomotion even in dream state and a connection terminated without caution would have resulting in death could have been a good idea. Aliens were thought to be not that intelligent (I mean while attacking they did not thought of flying. To add further 6th was human to figure out flight on that giant bird, OK I take back the later point.)

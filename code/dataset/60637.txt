The worlds best movie. I simply love the story, the music, the acting, the casting, the filming, the dialog, the flow of the story line, the director, the editing. The audio commentary is also great fun. A 3 hour movie that feels much less. I have re-watched this movie 20 times and I'm far from done with it.

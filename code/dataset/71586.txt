I think it was too long and boring. I never heard of John Nash before but when a film bases someone's life that I haven't a clue about, I wouldn't be interested. I only watched this because everybody was ranting on that it was a good movie and what not. I just didn't find it interesting, I know Russell Crowe was on this and he can be a good actor but, this isn't one of his best he has done. When he was in Les Miserables, boy it was worse in his film career too in my opinion!

I wanted to give this movie another star because the soundtrack was easy listening and pretty great! Maybe if I was into maths and know who John Nash was, then I would give this a 10/10 regardless of how long the movie is! I just didn't fancy watching it further, that's all I can say!

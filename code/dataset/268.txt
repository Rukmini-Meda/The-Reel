Les Miserables is an incredible story of how a man can turn his life around from a position of utter despair to a position where he can positively influence the lives of the people round him.

The film was beautifully choreographed with fantastic solo performances from Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in particular. It is a fantastic adaptation of the incredibly successful musical which has blessed us for many years.

Personally, I haven't seen the play for many years so when watching it I felt as if I was drowning in a sea of nostalgia.

My only problem with this film is that it is a bit miserable.

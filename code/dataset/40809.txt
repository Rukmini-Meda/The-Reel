'Smile at the camera and say CHEESE.' Were these the directions of the Wachowski brothers? I found that romantic gestures and apparent lines of sincerity were so unbelievable that I spent half of the film giggling! This film lacked the ingenuity and breakthrough qualities of the original Matrix leaving it simply an action film rather than continuing with its ability to mentally stimulate the audience. The films ending was given away prematurely by the Oracle's hint to Neo, as an audience we want to think for ourselves, for example,did they really need to say that agent Smith is Neo's opposite? Oh... I'd never of known!

I never thought that I'd say this but I wish that the matrix had never evolved into a trilogy, the first film was and will remain a classic. However saying that I still want a go in one of those ridiculous APU's, did they remind you of anything from the film Aliens?

KID: But sir i haven't finished my APU training!!!

MIFUNE: Neither did I.

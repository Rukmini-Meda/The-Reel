 I have seen Les Mis live on a couple of occasions so I knew the movie was not going to be an opera on the big screen. Using opera stars would have made it a big screen opera and it would have bombed since it offered nothing new. I also doubt that opera stars would have been able to handle the rigors these actors went through while carrying a tune...in my opinion. These actors brought the characters to life in ways no one else could. They showed the trials endured during this time period better than any book I have ever read. The singing parts ranged from good to excellent and I am impressed they were able to both sing and act their parts. I have seen it three times and the songs are still in my head they were so moving. Once you realize it's not Wolverine singing you get a 9 star rating for cast and story! I also suggest watching it with the closed captions on at least once. I missed a bit of the lyrics the first time around.

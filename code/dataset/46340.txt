The remake of a cult classic. Ray Harryhausen was responsible for the classic of the same title in 1981. What he used was stop/motion and it still works nowadays. I liked that flick a lot. Hollywood had to touch the classics because they are out of ideas. Most of them are failures and this version is a mediocre of the original.

I never went into any of the characters because the makers were more busy with the CGI used then with the story itself. It do has a few good moments like with the scorpions but there wasn't anything new to see. Th world of the Gods and the humans didn't work for me. It worked in Thor (2011) or in Immortals (2011). But in both those flicks we had a bit of brutality a thing we are missing here. Sometimes it even reminded me a bit of another failure, Van Helsing (2004). The problem there was too the fact that they forgot to put an actual story to it. Just have a look here. The metal owl that was important in Ray's flick is only shown for a few moments. What I did like and worked was Medusa.

They couldn't make it without CGI and I have nothing against it as it works but here it took the overhand and you never really get into the story. While writing my review I'm thinking who played who and that's not a good point.

Still, it entertains and for those never seen Ray's version it will deliver. But I was more into Ray's version. Maybe they went for a low rating so children could attend it at theatres. There's no nudity and no blood to spot. Yeah yeah, I know, one person is thrown in two by the scorpion but it is shown quickly. If you ever going to see Immortals or Thor you will know what I mean.

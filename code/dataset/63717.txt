The Matrix Revolutions brings the mind blowing trilogy to an end. For some, it brought resolution, for others not. Whether or not you are a fan of the Matrix series the most important attribute to Revolutions is being able to understand it. No doubt the effects, albeit stunning, cannot save the Matrix, as we learned in Reloaded. This time around the acting and dialog was infinitely better, however, even these redeeming factors don't fill the gap completely. I loved this film, more than previous two - and is one of my favorites of all time, for that matter - but it's mostly accredited to the fact that I understand what happened in Revolutions. I'm not out to spoil it for anyone, but I have met more than enough of others who have seen this film and don't understand it, as well as do, to see that those who find Revolutions to be nothing but enigmatic hate the film more than all of the three. Consequently, those who have a grasp on what happened enjoyed the experience as much as I did and feel the same way I do.

The Wachowski brothers, perhaps, could have portrayed the finale with a little more clarity; but I find it ashame that so many have come to hate this trilogy upon seeing Revolutions. It goes to show how important it is to pay attention to the little details we sometimes disregard in such an action-oriented trilogy as the Matrix. There really is more to it. And once you understand the film, you get to love the rest of it: the action, the characters, the story, even more. 9/10

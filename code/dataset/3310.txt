It is the non fiction drama about the life of a renowned scientist, who is extremely genius but suffers a mental disorder.

It is basically beautiful story but at the sake time, you'll be slightly thrilled by cleverness of the main character. Admittedly, he is respectable in terms of his magnificent scientific achievement, but as for his real life, he is completely corrupted being as a human and is unable to distinguish the fact and illusion. Therefore, you will hold a contradicted evaluation toward him as great but terrifying. Above all, when you encounter the fact that has been hidden till the end, you have no choice to feel threatened to him.

To sum up, the title of beautiful mind sounds very ironic to me because his superb mind, perhaps, is not beautiful for him.

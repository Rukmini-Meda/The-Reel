Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace marks the start of the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, I know many people hate this film for some reason but didn't. It has amazing action scenes and the fight choreography is amazing, and the music is beautiful to listen to. This was a great movie and I really enjoyed it as much as the others.

I give 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' a 9/10

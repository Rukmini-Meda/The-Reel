I had gone into "A beautiful mind" expecting a great performance from all the leading actors, the only thing I wasn't sure of was Ron Howard's direction... after the lamentable 'The Grinch' I wasn't sure whether he was up to the task of bringing the life of john Nash to the screen.

To my overwhelming surprise, Howard as crafted a magnificent film with true heart, visually, emotionally, superb. I saw on the trivia section attached to this film that Tom Cruise was set to play Nash. That would have not worked.

Im truly glad he didn't. Russell Crowe inhibits Nash with every fibre of his being, for a while there you forget its him. Tom cruise had never done that for me. But the biggest surprise was Jennifer Connelly's performance as Alicia Nash that stood out from the crowd, Im happy that after toiling away in bad movies for so long she is finally getting material that showcases her natural talent.

I loved this film and recommend it to anyone, young, old... its just a great experience.

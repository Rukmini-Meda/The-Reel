Why are so many people hating on this movie? If read up on anything about it, it's a DISASTER movie! Not a Best Picture Oscar-winning film, not a perfectly acted feature, but a disaster movie; everything blows up, people die, and no one has (or should have) any clue of what to do as hell is being unleashed. That's almost what happens in 2012, and it works. I can see why some people do criticize aspects of the film, but if you don't want a disaster movie, go somewhere else; watch Schindler's List (great movie) or something like that. 2012 is a fun, intense adventure that is a HUGE "what if" on the supposed Mayan Prophecy.

The two main actors in this movie (John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor) stole the show, portraying the two main protagonists in this story about the truth behind the Mayan calender ending on December 21, 2012 that proclaims the end of the world is coming. The one character/actor that should have won critical appraisal for his role was Oliver Platt as the main antagonist; he believes the needs of the few surpass the needs of the many, which doesn't sit well with others.

Overall, with great CGI, decent to good acting, pretty good story, and some likable characters, 2012 is a fun and entertaining ride into the end of one world and the beginning of another. The big question that haters should ask themselves when reading this is, "What would you do when the end comes?" What i know is that you don't know what others would do if it did come. Therefore, the actions of the characters in the movie are plausible (except for some of the incredibly close calls).

The Matrix Revolutions, the third part of Andy and Larry Wachowski's Matrix trilogy, fittingly ends what will be considered in the near future as one of cinema's classic trilogies. Though this third outing into the Matrix universe is the weakest of the three films, it's still an outstanding film with a great ending. Unlike part 2, this film has character development giving the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, as well as new characters Link and Niobe) something to do with their characters. Although I am disappointed that most of the film doesn't take place in the Matrix itself, if you look at the structure of the trilogy, it does make sense and I respect the Wachowskis for sticking with their vision even if they did alienate some of their core audience. Again, Don Davis' score is superb (not as good as Reloaded's score but nearly up there and definitely better than his first Matrix score). This is a fitting 7 out of 10 and a must-see, if only to see how the Matrix trilogy ends.

Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a scientist who warns the President that the world is in trouble. They decide to build massive arks to save the few and the world's treasures.

Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a frustrated writer who works as a limo driver. His ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and his 2 kids live with her new boyfriend. A series of events convinces Jackson that something is wrong and the group goes on a long thrilling journey to find the arks.

The first half is fun. Roland Emmerich has created a massive roller coaster ride. It's Moviegeddon. The science be damn... until the second half. Let's just say the whole ark thing is ridiculous. Even for a mindless popcorn movie, this is still too stupid.

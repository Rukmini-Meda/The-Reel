Now that I have watched this movie, I have gained new hope, as I hope to life like the Na'Vi in the movie. This is what happened in real life in a lot of wars on earth, but now it's up to nature to help the people who haven't neglected their own planet, by building concrete and buildings, instead of letting nature do its job. Mankind literally stopped their planet from functioning how it was in the beginning times. It is impossible NOT to like this movie for its originality, and accurate representation of how earth would have looked like when people lived in peace with nature, instead of destroying it. Also when alien life forces attacked earth when they were one with nature. It is a beautiful thing. I would definitely recommend watching this movie with a clean mind, not judging everything, and just let emotion overwhelm you. Preemptive judgement ruins most experiences of movies, as people force themselves to watch it, just to ruin it for themselves. Such phenomenons can also be seen in modern media, Americans generally dislike Russia, and as a result, they find evidence hidden for any suspicious activities to blackmail that country, while they can blame any country for all the bad things they do, but don't. That's why I recommend everyone to form their own opinions, and not to be blinded by what other people say and do.

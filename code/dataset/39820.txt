I saw this movie last Saturday and was pretty excited because I had read all the raving reviews and heard what a masterpiece it was. Then, when I actually watched it, I was like...what's the big deal about this movie?

The bad things:

It was WAY too long. There's nothing wrong with long movies, but only if the story is engaging and interesting. Amadeus was just slow and boring. In my opinion, there was no reason for this film to be 3 hours long. No matter how impressive and extravagant costumes and backdrops are, it does not make a movie exciting. This is a problem I've seen in quite a few big-budget films. About two hours into the film, I got very, very sleepy and I could barely keep my eyes open (okay, this might have been because I was watching the movie at 11pm).

The good things:

F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both did a good job. I didn't see a single flaw in their performances. The brief scenes of the insane asylum were effectively disturbing. The costumes, scenery, style, etc, all seemed to be intact. Giving Amadeus that quirky laugh was...a fun idea, I must admit.

So the bottom line is, I won't watch this movie again but I'm glad I saw it once. And 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' was a much better film by Milos Forman.

Ideally this would be zero out of 10, the 1 is purely to satisfy the comment criteria.

I loved Les Miserables on stage, and have a few soundtrack recordings. The 25th anniversary DVD was and is stunning.

So how did they get a big screen production so wrong, especially after the excellent big screen version of 'Phantom'.

Perhaps the magic of Les Miserables doesn't translate to the big screen.

Or probably it was tragic miscasting for the roles. To hear most of the cast ruin classic songs, and for set pieces like 'Master of the house' to be trashed is galling. In fact hearing Borat 'sing' it like he's auditioning for 'allo 'allo utterly ruined it for me. At least nobody else attempted a 'comedy' French accent.

The only highlight of the film was Samantha Barks, who sang and acted perfectly.

Which begs the question, why did they not cast actors and addresses from the stage shows ? The show is a worldwide phenomenon, and packed with vocal talent.

Hopefully this will be a warning for any future musical adaptations. DON'T rely on a big name cast, as a musical lives and dies on vocal ability.

If you loved the stage show then avoid this turkey. Invest in the 25th Anniversary DVD instead.

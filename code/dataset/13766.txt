 watch Amadeus was one of the best things I've ever done, I've never been a fan of movie musicals, nor dramatic comedy, more Amadeus can do I really like two genres that I am not a fan, the film made me laugh many times, especially with Mozart, which is pretty funny in this film, the cast is great, F. Murray Abraham this great, Oscar more than deserved, Tom Hulce which was also nominated for best actor, this great, more F. Murray was a little best, Simon Callow, Roy Dotrice, Christine Ebersole, etc., all the actors are properly, no compromises, the direction of Milos Forman's excellent photography of the film is impeccable, the costume is great, has very good times, the pace is good, more the film gets tiresome in the last 30 minutes, plus those 30 minutes are essential pro film, more that are slow, they are yes, Amadeus is one of the best movies I have been fortunate to watch with an impeccable cast a memorable performance of F. Murray Abraham, and an excellent direction of Milos Forman. note 10

I am not sure what to say... Stallone should spend more money on the movie rather than on the cast. It's hard to see what actually happened especially in the fight scenes which is the most important thing in this movie. The movie wasn't funny at all, the shooting and explosions wasn't close too good, illogical scenes and the list goes on.

As a big fan of Stallone I am truly disappointed and sad at the same time. I like all of his movies that I have seen; while some are better than others, but this one I didn't enjoy for one minute. I hope that The Expendables 2 is better. This music describes how I feel on his best: Dan Hill - It's A Long Road from the - great - movie Rambo: First Blood.

A Beautiful Mind starts kind of slowly, the first part seems a bit long, even a bit boring sometimes, though the thriller atmosphere manages to captivate the viewer.

What makes the movie is its beautiful second part, sublimated by Russel Crowe's performance with his John Nash character.

One problem comes up though when a movie relies on a twist, which is the case here for the first part: once you know it, re-watching the movie is less interesting. And since that first half is already a bit boring, it doesn't help at all.

As for the direction, it is very classic, perhaps a bit too much, but ultimately efficient.

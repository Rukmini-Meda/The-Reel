 I guess this is based on the Mayan calender thing. You know, the one that didn't happen. The CGI is pretty good. I wonder how many narrow, almost but not quite gotcha escapes can one believe might happen? I have a big problem with the plot of this film. They sell tickets to the rich to finance the arks, the huge vessels (?) intended to save a remnant of humanity by riding out the enormous tsunamis that will occur. The world is ending, who cares about money, print all you need, who will bring you to task? If you are serious about saving humanity you want the best, brightest, young, fertile people you can find plus some experienced crew and scientists, not the old and rich or powerful. Then there is the scene with helicopters carrying elephants, plus the on board one showing several live animals. Why? Use frozen ova and sperm. You can store a lot more species as well as higher numbers of each type thereby allowing more humans on board. John Cusack does okay in the lead role and saves everyone on board his ark at the last second. Again to many close calls to be believable. After things settle down the surviving humans end up going to Africa to start over, where we began. Entertaining yes but not close to reality.

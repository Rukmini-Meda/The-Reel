Even with the acting and film that was made, it could have been edited into a better film. That has been proved, for those that don't know look it up, I won't mention the name here. Just by removing a lot of the Jar Jar scene stealing, and Anakins "accidents" the movie would have been a lot stronger.

The acting wasn't the worst I've seen, and the plot was decent except dragging. But just know that it could have been better if George Lucas cared enough to higher a good editor that didn't just say "Yes." when George wanted to leave one of his Pet ideas in there.

George's excuse now is that Star Wars is a "Kids" movie. And I guess if that's all he wanted to target, then by all means, he succeeded. But it sounds more like an excuse to get around his bad movie.

-It's been happening to him a lot lately..

Look at the recent Indiana Jones and relate that to the other films in that group....

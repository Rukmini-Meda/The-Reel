 I thought this was a solid, good film, I don't know why it got lower ratings on IMDb.com then "Pacific Rim", which in my opinion had sub par performances. The follow up movie "Wrath of the Titans" in my opinion was worse, but to each his own i guess. Don't watch this movie in 3-D. Most movies are better once you get over the hype of the retro 3-D experience. Especially if you already wear glasses, having to wear the special 3-d glasses over top makes it very annoying. And for non glasses wearer who aren't use to them, it makes your field of vision blocked off and the whole point of going to the big screen pointless. 3-D isn't for every movie, in my opinion outer space works best.But Seriously why would you watch this film in 3-D? Regardless of all that the film would have gotten higher ratings were it just normal in non 3-D.

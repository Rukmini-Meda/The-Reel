Star Wars (before "A New Hope" was added) was the first movie I ever saw in the theater, and I fell in love with everything everybody else did. It had an engaging story, interesting characters, great action, and awesome special effects. I was fortunate enough to get to see Empire and Jedi in the theater as well.

My love of the Star Wars kept with me, though during my late teen years i was starting see flaws in the dialogue and a few plot hole; but story, character, and action still kept that love going.

The comes this, the first prequel. Same engaging level of story, same calibre characters, same level of special effects (when you factor the time of release), same great kind of action. Dialogue is once again flawed at times, and there are plot holes. Acting? As good as it can be with the dialogue.

When it comes down to it, if I were to abandon this (and its sequels) for its flaws, I would have abandoned the original trilogy for the same reasons.

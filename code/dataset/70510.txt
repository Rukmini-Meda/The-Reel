"Avatar" is a title gained from "Sanskrit" language of India and the story technology concept shown in this movie are from Hollywood So it is a mixture of "Hindi title+English Concept".

The movie when I watched it on my DVD I felt a great excitement when I was watching it the direction was very good after all it's a " James Cameroon" movie man!!!!

The acting was very good and the concept was just looked a bit epic the technology war machines and the vehicles were just awesome.

Though I felt a little bored while there was a chemistry between two pandorians "Jack and Neytiri" but overall it was good and never seen concept movie.

And it was also a bit Unforgettable.

Hail Hollywood!!!

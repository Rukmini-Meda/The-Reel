The film 'Avatar' (2009) is directed by James Cameron and explores many environmental issues. The film follows Jake Sully, a marine as he learns how to live like a native on the moon Pandora. The military have made a base on Pandora and create Avatars that Jake and other scientists control to live with Na'vi. The film explores how different groups treat the environment and show how it is significant in sustaining life. As the film progresses it shows how all living organisms form some sort of symbiotic relationship. The Na'vi calls the environment and the spirit that controls everything Eywa. Eywa connects every living thing and gives reason to each event. The Na'vi connect to Eywa by some sort of neuron connection. This connection allows them to feel what Eywa feels and connect and understand other organisms. In comparison the Humans destroy the environment and are extremely aggressive. They have no connection to their environment and the environment of others as they destroy whatever they want for their own benefit. The film also explores how an organism's soul is precious and shows that one event has a significant event on another. The film contains many shots that show how beautiful the environment is and uses its CGI to the fullest. The environments are beautiful, lush and glowing with colour. This allows the audience to appreciate the environment more and feel more anger against the humans for destroying it. It causes the audience to think about how this is a reality and humans are in fact destroying the environment. The realistic story explored is strong and catches the viewers' attention from the very beginning. James Cameron does a beautiful job as he makes a simple but compelling story that explores many important environmental issues.

In 2154, the earth is running out of resources and destroyed by human. Therefore, human are looking for another planet where they could move into. In the end, they find Pandora which has a beautiful atmosphere and many new plants. Pandora is where Na'vi people who has blue skin and big yellow eyes live in the harmony with mother goddess called Eywa. However, the atmosphere is toxic for human. In order to explore Pandora, the scientists create a Na'vi body called Avatar. By using that body, human could live and act normally in Pandora. Jake Sully is one of the first persons who join in this experiment. The group tries to gather the Na'vi's intelligence about plants and the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. However, after being rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi and live with the Na'vi more than three months, Jake feel sympathize to them. He cooperates with the Na'vi to prevent them from attacking by human. This movie is directed by James Camaron. He cherishes this movie from his childhood for more than ten years. This movie uses many music, sound tracks and visual effects such as 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. This makes audiences who watch it in 3-D form feel like they live in a completely different world. This technique helps them feel how the beautiful and amazing Pandora is and look like the Na'vi stand in front of them. Moreover, the actor Sam Worthington who plays as Jake Sally is wonderful and he makes everyone remember how brave he is to protect Pandora with his life. Avatar is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I am impressed by its excited, amazing and how beautiful another world is.

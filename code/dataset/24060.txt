I feel like as a movie, this is a nicely made and done film that could do a decent job in entertaining the viewer throughout the duration of it. It is really when you go on and compare it to the other movies of the Star Wars universe, mostly the older movies and Rogue One, that this does not look so good. I wouldn't say it's the worst but I would easily say it's the weakest in terms of helping the series forward.

With that aside, I will list off the things I like and don't like here. I believe that the acting is pretty sound for the most part, the man exception just being Natalie Portman who I though that while a great actress, was not really good in this movie or the other two prequels. I have to give Jake Lloyd a pass since he was a kid. But Liam Neeson, Ian McDirmand, and Ewan Mcgregor all did great jobs. The effects were also really amazing and also so for the time. The fight and actions scenes were fantastic. And the planet of Coursant, while the scene on the end of itself is boring, is a really nice setting place.

As for negatives, I feel that pacing is way off. I have no problem with the whole political story line or anything since there already was political stories in the Star Wars universe and this expanded it, so maybe that was needed. But with the pacing it's just awful. At one moment we're talking politics then the next we are in a spacehsip to a desert and then we have a race and then we are talking politics again and then we are in a giant battle and then a funeral and how to handle Anakin and then politics again. I just wish that it picked one or two themes and sticked with it.

Overall, it isn't that bad of a movie. I have some issues with it, but as a whole it could have been a lot worse. Nowhere near the worst movie ever as some people try to claim. Just a disappointing one.

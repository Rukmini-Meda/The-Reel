I was fortunate enough to be a kid when it came out and was engulfed into the whole Star Wars world prior to seeing the movie. My brother and I had collected action figures together, playing out our own stories in the house with them and battling each other. Phantom Menace came along at the perfect time for us, as we were still at the young age of 8-10 and welcomed the new characters/settings to our imagination... Being a movie first, and foremost, it stands alone well on its own with a proper flow of story from beginning to end. Star Wars is all about adventure and the whole movie brings you along on a journey from planet to planet; from going under sea in the inner core of Naboo to meeting Vader as an ace racing podracer on Tattooine and to seeing more of the world of Coruscant, which we had only briefly saw at the end of Return of the Jedi. There is plenty of excitement and fun, and that's what the movie's about.

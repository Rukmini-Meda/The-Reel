I loved the first Matrix and the last one, but I only liked the second one. Reloaded went somewhere far from what Wachovski could afford to develop, and I afraid they were just busy planning visual effects and forgot about time limit of screenplay. The brothers put to many things in it, but in fact Reloaded has neither clear beginning nor ending. I was thinking how could Matrix finish, but Revolutions was much better than I expected. Many Hollywood patterns (boring pathos, soap opera, stupid jokes) but spectacular beyond any limits + great (although with many questions) story 9.5/10

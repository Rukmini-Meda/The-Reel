Clash of the titans is great but they could have made it better if it wasn't for some mistakes which is pretty annoying. First of all the Kraken was a giant squid that crashed ships and so on, didn't look like that, this Kraken looked more like that pale alien that get sucked out in the space in the end in one of the Alien movies, don't remember which Alien movie to be honest. Second the the flying horsey Pegasos should have been white and not black, you guys should have done more research. Now the third thing and that was the fighting scenes was to short, like against Kraken and Hades just trowing a sword and he goes down to the underworld again... thought he was more powerful than that...could have dodged it or grabbed it. Oh yes one more thing, too many died in the underworld like Mads Mikkelsen should have survived too famous to die:")

This move didn't suck the sequel did and so did The immortals!

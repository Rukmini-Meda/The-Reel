In the film Amadeus, Dir. Milos Forman, Antonio Salieri is a composer who was faithful to God all his life because he believed that God answered his prayers to make him a famous composer. He never touched women, he helped the musicians in the community, and he taught children, a lot of them for free as a way to thank God for answering his prayers. He was completely faithful, never harmed anyone until Mozart came along into the scene of music in his own community. The "giggling dirty minded" Antonio says, gains much more fame and becomes well known throughout Europe which drove Antonio frustrated because even when he is sticking to God, Mozart still got more fame and more successful, and in Antonio's opinion it is not fair because Mozart is as far away as possible from God.

The original music composed by both Antonio Salieri and Amadeus is absolutely breathtaking, and it was well put as a non-diegetic music in the background while some action is going on in the film and as an actual on screen performance.

Tom Hulce, played the role of Mozart, acted the young, goofy character in such a way that will make you emotionally involved with it and make you feel the sense of frustration that we get from Antonio throughout the film.

The cinematography in this film was a mix of static shots and truck movement shots. There wasn't anything too complicated which I personally loved because it gives us the feeling that the music alone is driving the events of the film forward.

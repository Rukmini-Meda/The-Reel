I am writing this review in 2014, the reason was to wait and see how people respond to this movie and get to see how they see movies in general..To be frank very disappointed in the way people disdain certain movies as they keep certain set standard expectations from all the movies, even when the movies specifically pre-hand do tell that they are not offering certain elements. People need to start to be flexible, and stop being to sensitive and ruthless in their criticism. As for avatar, well this is what 3D was invented for. The joy in not only in enjoying 3D, but in enjoying Pandora, experience it.How often do we look at the beautiful scenery of nature and think of Holidaying there. The world Pandora is porn for a nature poet. Many complain that the story is too simple, seen a lot of times, and nothing new. That's true. But there is a reason for that, Avatar isn't about interaction of characters among themselves, it's about the characters interacting the world for you. That's the reason why the story is kept simple on purpose, for the audience to enjoy the visual delight. Also it is kept simple so that the message is delivered quite loud and you don't reminisce on any convolution(or lack of) in the story. Critics would cut few marks for so simple story, but the thing is it's not about what the story is,it's about how it is delivered and Avatar scores full marks on it.It sure doesn't feel the same when watched in 2D or on television and it's repeat watch value dies after a couple of times. Background score too is simple but very well made-specifically-for-the- movie.

This movie is widely considered in the community of film critics to be a landmark in motion picture history and is rightfully so ranked up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca as one the best movies in history. The lines are iconic, the scenes of family, betrayal and violence are all memorable, the performances are beyond Oscar worthy and it does what any great adaptation does; stay as faithful to the original as possible and only make changes whenever necessary. For me the most iconic scene is the baptism murders, which I fell are appropriately edited as Michael Corleone oversees the baptism of his infant son. The only minor nitpick I have is that, although Marlon Brando does give a solid performance, the look they gave him is a little too much like a geezer for me to believe he is a Mafia don. Nonetheless, this is a film that anyone taking a cinema class should watch.

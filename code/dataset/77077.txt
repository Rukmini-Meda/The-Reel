The film is filled with music. At first thought this thing could resist people to watch the film. But it is unbelievable that opera can be so much beautiful. The film is a must watch for everyone or I would say an important film. Because it is about Mozart, the name that we all have heard since childhood. The length of the film is long. I watched the director's cut which is about 3 hours and to watch a film 3 hours long I had to think a lot before watching. But I must say that it was 3 hours of pure fun. The acting from both the main characters is superb. The story keeps you attached to the film always(mainly because of the acting.). Then at some point of times you will find opera shown at length and the interesting fact is that you will like it. I must say it was 3 hours well spent.

"A must watch for each and everyone."

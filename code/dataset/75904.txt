 I don't understand so much negatives to JAR JAR BINKS. I like the way George Lucas made this movie. This World is so magick and the soundtrack i so wonderful. I like the story and I like the characters. I think The Phantom Menace has the best lightsaber fight scenes ever made in the Star Wars history. I still love episode 4,5,6 as well as 1,2,3. Pod racing is the one of the best action scene ever made to this day. Qui-Gon Jinn is my favorite Jedi ever ;]. Did I say anything about beautiful soundtrack.WoooW just WooooW. So bad George Lucas will never make any new Star Wars ever. In the end I hate episode 7 ;]. JJ.Abrams Star Wars is like Star Trek in the space.

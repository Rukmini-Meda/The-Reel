I liked the movie. Its fun and like another reviewer put it: Entertaining. The philosophy was left a bit aside... pity. The romance is a bit slapstick and silly sometimes. The directing was weak too.

The film was lacking in respect to the other versions... but the action compensated IMHO. I like the series and I am prone to forgiving their less than good directing. Watch the first one more times to compensate and be happy... otherwise you won't provide enough battery power.

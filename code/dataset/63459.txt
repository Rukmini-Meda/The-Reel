I've avoided this movie until now, however when a neighbour invited us to visit and watch it while being amazed by his 3D video system, diplomacy meant that saying "no" was a little difficult.

It was every bit as bad as I'd heard. The story was cliched, simplistic and quite cynically aimed at all those "liberals" who recognise the evils of colonialism and greed. The characters were, at best, cardboard cut-outs. So why did I give it two points? Well, I do have to admit that the colour and CGI scenery were impressive, as was the 3D effect - though by the end my eyes were beginning to complain.

Had it come on the TV at home, I'd have promptly changed channels and I'm very glad I did not pay to see it as, apart from the special effects of various kinds, this is a load of arrant tripe.

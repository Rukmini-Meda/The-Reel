It is unfortunate that so many people went into viewing this epic film with certain expectations, mainly so because it was considered to be a "remake". I went to see it with a friend who wanted to take a look at it on its own merits and we did just that. There were definitely no expectations on my part so I was not disappointed like some of the reviewers here who do not have enough objectivity to see this movie for what it is.

I totally enjoy these types of films, it was very good and easy to watch, with astounding visual effects and scenes. For sheer entertainment value, Clash of the Titans is one of the better movies being released this year and I highly recommend viewing it.

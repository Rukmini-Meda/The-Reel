When the movie 2012 came out it was superb! A film about the planet finally crumbling to pieces while everyone is in a panic to try and run from it, this film has some fast paced action. Now they're several parts in the movie where you can see the green screen work, and no the acting through out the whole movie is not the best, but for what it is the movie rocked.

I loved the story concept and where they took it, the ark idea was really cool. For the most part the graphics were great and the cast picked for the film were some of my favorites, so as a fan I surely enjoyed it. Out of all of the "end of time" films that were popping out back 2009 this one was one of the best. I've watched this film over and over and again the film is not perfect it is just awesome.

Coming from a Broadway background, I was super excited to see Les Miserables! I saw it in theaters twice (once at the midnight premiere in my city and again with my friends), and overall loved it!

There's always a "but", though. Casting, in my opinion, is what cost the Oscar for this movie. Russell Crowe looked scared and sounded like he had nasal issue; he did not meet the expectations of the masculine Javert, which is why I felt a little relief during "Javert's Suicide". Amanda Seyfried was innocent, like Cosette is supposed to be, but her voice was too small. Hugh Jackman would've made a great Javert, and really brought a grand perspective to Jean Valjean.

The make-up and costuming was outstanding and really brought out contrast between rich and poor; sick and healthy. And all the death scenes were well produced (Fantine's Death, Little People or Gavroche's Death, A Little Fall of Rain or Eponine's death, the Final Battle Scene). Overall, it was true to the story and is really worth seeing 9/10

The 2012 version of Les Miserables is a dark, rather depressing take on Victor Hugo's classic, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's full of immense talent and the majority of these actors surprised me because they actually know how to sing. This film will make even the toughest cry just a little, because this is such an emotional story. This is a near-classic that surpasses the last adaptation of Les Miserables in every way.

Tom Hooper directs a musical based on the events that took place during the French Revolution of 1848. This is a battle between good vs. the law and more specifically Jean Valijean vs. Javert. Valijean, who served 19 years for stealing bread and skipped parole, is on the run from Javert who believes nothing upholds the law.

The acting is utterly fantastic in this film. This movie couldn't have been made with lesser acting. Anne Hathaway is fantastic and really gives me the chills during her rendition, "I Dreamed a Dream." Hugh Jackman was just as good as Valijean and he moved me with his performance. Russell Crowe was surprisingly good and I was impressed at his singing voice. We also got some great performances out of Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baren Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter.

Overall, this is a great, well-done musical version of this classic novel. The production values are top-notch and the songs are wonderfully sung. The original song, "Suddenly" was a welcome addition to the film. Don't be ashamed if this makes you cry by the end, because it definitely will. I rate this film 9/10.

Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents.

F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy...

Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.

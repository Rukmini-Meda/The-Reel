Is it just me that thinks this film could have had so much more to it? Yes? No? Because in actuality, Action Films are better than this - at least the ones done properly, anyway. I already reviewed Expendables 2 because honestly, I love it - the faults I have with this one, though, are bigger and they stick out more. Ah well, not all films are perfect. Obviously you're aware of the fact that Austin and Stallone collide and face-off against each other. What even was that, guys? In all honesty that fight should have ended up much differently. Stallone got his ass handed to him, I mean, Austin literally beat the crap out of him, when Barney Ross (Stallone) is meant to be the meanest, toughest mercenary in recent-years.

The Expendables ends with the main bad guy getting killed, and Eric Roberts wasn't really a threat at all, if you ask me. It's not the same as the second one, when it's JCVD; he's definitely a bigger threat who's more superior. Even the second one has a better co-villain, and that's Scott Adkins, he's a huge threat in comparison to Eric Roberts, in this one.

I did love the film, in some ways admittedly. I mean, it had some of the biggest action-stars of all-time in it, that's a great treat for us retro-lovers and action-fans. Schwarzenegger should have had a bigger and better role in it, though. Luckily Schwarzenegger appears a lot throughout the second one. The Expendables is a bit of an old-school thrill-ride with some badass weaponry and great moments of far-fetched action. Enjoy it if you've not seen it yet, guys. Admittedly, it is a pretty great action-extravaganza. 7.3/10.

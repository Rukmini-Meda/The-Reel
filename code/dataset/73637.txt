I must be weird, because I haven't found anyone else that has the same opinion as I do about The Matrix Trilogy. The first one was obviously fantastic, but I hated the second one. Therefore, I expected to hate the third one, only to be pleasantly surprised by what I saw.

My chief complaint against The Matrix Reloaded is that it relied too heavily on philosophy mumbo-jumbo that I just couldn't follow it; that is, if I really wanted to. This time around, things were still a little confusing. It started a little slow, and the ending was a bit questionable, but everything in between was action-packed.

The Mechwarrior-like weapons the people of Zion used were quite impressive and fun to watch. The whole battle at Zion just had so much going on that you can't help but marvel at the level of special effects this movie achieves. The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was quite impressive also. After all the battles they've had over the trilogy, I didn't know how this one can be any different or any more special, but the Wachowski brothers definitely raised it up to another level.

Like I said, this movie is still pretty confusing. However, if you read other reviews or visit some Matrix sites, things get a little clearer and will give you a different perspective. All in all, though, The Matrix Revolutions is a pretty fun, action-packed sci-fi extravaganza.

My IMDb Rating: 8/10. My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)

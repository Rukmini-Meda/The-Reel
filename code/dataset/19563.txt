Only very few people can really relate to this movie, but the direction of this movie shows how it is to be mentally ill, makes you feel for the character and makes you believe things he is seeing are actually real and not only his imagination. Although, i would have loved to see more in - depth details about his work and the actual things he is doing research on, not only showing all of his walls of every office being covered in papers and strings. The character of his supervisor and his best friend seemed extremely real and i bet you it is impossible to even imagine that they are his imagination before it gets layed out for you.

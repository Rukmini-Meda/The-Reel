 Titling this movie Clash of The Titans is a complete joke. The story was so butchered that this movie has very little to do with the Greek myth or the original movie. This was nothing short of a hatchet job meant to spew some pretentious, pseudo-political garbage about man replacing gods. They eliminated most everything that was good about the original movie and downplayed the rest. What is left over is rushed and, in many respects, poorly produced. The characters were dull, the action tame and the plot was annoying. Frankly I have seen cartoons that I liked better than this. I'm hoping that this movie will be another Incredible Hulk. The first blows chunks, but in a few years someone will make a remake of the remake and do the job right. Then movie fans will have something worth watching.

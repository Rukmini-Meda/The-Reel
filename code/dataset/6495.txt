If you want to see Clash of the Titans with a compelling narrative, good creatures, good action sequences, and a SUPERB cast, watch the 1981 original. It may be a little dated, and some of the effects are certainly old-fashioned by today's standards, but it has something the remake doesn't even come close to achieving: - Class!

If you are brain-dead, have a limited attention span, are totally ignorant of (and have no interest in) ancient Greek mythology, and basically just want lots of standard quality CGI, one-dimensional characters, and a plot dumbed-down to the point that there is no longer anything there, then watch the remake; a mindless, soulless, travesty that insults the intelligence of the viewer, and does everything it can to destroy all that was good about the original.

The director has publicly claimed to be a fan of the original, but this seems very unlikely based on his so-called homage featuring the mechanical owl from the 1981 film. His treatment of that classic prop/character could not have been more dismissive and insulting. It clearly shows how little he respected the original film, as do pretty much all of his other directorial choices.

A terrible and entirely pointless film.

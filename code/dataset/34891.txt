 Clash of the Titans (2010): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Alexa Davalos, Gemma Arterton: Pure garbage based solely around CGI effects. With that it delivers on its monstrous sea titan the Kraken as well as giant scorpions, the winged Pegasus, and the snake haired Gorgon Medusa who can turn her victims to stone at a glance. What makes the original so much better is its passion for character and story. This film misses out on the whole back story regarding Calibos and his curse regarding Andromeda, as well as the bitterness amongst the gods. Director Louis Leterrier subtracts any dramatic impact of the original for cheap tie in scenes such as the sword in the forest or the Pegasus horses that just happen to be around. The original used great dramatic payoff to produce these elements. Leterrier had better luck when he made The Incredible Hulk. Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus is a joke. Liam Neeson as Zeus is an even bigger joke showing his perverted authority. Ralph Fiennes as Hades is a laugh. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda just hangs in midair. Watching her take pity on Perseus will make us long for the authority and boldness that Judi Bowker possessed when she performed this role correctly. Gemma Arterton also graces us with her presence and it couldn't be any less welcome than it is when combine with this garbage. The special effects are the norm but even CGI is hardly a replacement when the original had stop motion creativity by Ray Harryhausen that is the stuff of great imaginative imagery. This remake should clash with a fireplace. Score: 1 / 10

Incredibly bad. Incredibly stupid.

SouthPark's "Team America" had better fight scenes and a more credible plot.

If this is American Values then we are in a world of hurt and deserve to get our butts kicked. There are real Bad Guys who run and ruin countries and there are real Good Guys who work to stop them. (Try our US Special Forces as an example.) But taking a bunch of mercenary has beens and having them try to get rid of the Bad Guys is a joke sort of like a old timer Biker Movie.

This movie is an incredible waste of time and will make you stupider if you watch it.

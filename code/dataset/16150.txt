 The well known story of Les miserables as a musical, this time, for me, it failed to deliver. The amazing cast and the beautiful shots and sequences of the revolution and the struggles that people had to endure, are overshadowed by the failure the keep the interest high throughout the movie. The songs focus mainly on the drama, but they do get boring, especially for someone who doesn't love musicals, but just wanted to see what all the buzz was about. The performances were splendid, although, for me, having the con couple act as the comical part of the film felt out of place and sometimes ridiculous. So 3 out of 10.

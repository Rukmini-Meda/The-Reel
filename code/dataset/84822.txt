The story of John Nash, Nobel Prize-winning economist. We see him from his days as a student at Princeton University to his later life. Just when he seems to have everything going for him - a beautiful, loving wife and a successful academic career - he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The lines between reality and his imagination, driven by his powerful mind, become blurred...

Powerful, emotional drama, largely based on a true story. The way Nash is able to overcome his disability and become one of the foremost minds in the field of economics is amazing, and a sight to see. The demons in his mind also provide for some great drama, especially discerning what is reality and what is a function of his mind.

Won the 2002 Best Picture Oscar.

The reason why so many people decide to like this film is because they're afraid that if they don't, they'll seem cold or heartless. No one will ever admit that, but it's not a spoiler to tell you that the film is filled with tragedy. I first saw the musical on stage and it was breathtaking. I was so excited that I'd be able to relive that experience by watching it on my television whenever I wanted. That would have been marvelous!

Unfortunately, the director, coming with the Oscar halo left over from The King's Speech, fancied himself a visionary. He chose celebrity actors who couldn't sing to play the parts "raw and real," as Russell Crowe put it. This means it wasn't a musical. It was acted just fine, but it was all wonky. It came off worse than community theater, as if they were playing with the idea of singing, but were too self-conscious to actually do it.

The story, originally 1,000+ page book that I read every word of, could barely squeak into a musical. In the stage production there were lots of things happening very quickly, but the music made it work. If you want a truly profound experience hear On My Own, I Dreamed a Dream, or Empty Chairs at Empty Tables sung live with a professional company. I worry that this film has ruined that unique experience for many people who will have the talking/not- quite-singing performances stuck in their heads--Hugh Jackman doing a parody of Bring Him Home! (Really, Kristen Chenoweth's version from her new album, Coming Home, is a million times better. *She* can actually sing!)

The real tragedy is that no one is going to be rushing out to remake this film any time soon so we can have an adequate version of the Broadway experience for our Apple TV's and Blu-Ray players. Too many people glow about it. Too many people are ashamed to criticize a film about sad, sad people. ...and who wants to follow up and remake such a critically acclaimed film? It will be decades! I'm very sad.

I love this movie so much! Wow what a great story and I cannot believe that it's based on a true story. The acting is so great in this movie! Russell Crowe is so amazing in this film!! You really feel for his character and you feel bad that he has this illness. Russell Crowe is such an interesting and unique character as well and he is so smart and you really go into a journey with him. I love that this movie really show that mental illness is a real thing and that it shouldn't be stigmatized at all. This movie makes you feel for those who are dealing with mental illness and you want them to get the help that they need. I will always love this movie and it will always be a favorite of mine and it will always be a favorite of mine.

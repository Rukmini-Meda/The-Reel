It's a great movie but can get boring. If you hate dialogue i recommend not watching this movie. If you love it then of course by all means watch it. The acting is superb, Marlon Brando is incredible, surprisingly a lot of people didn't like him in this movie but i did. The screenwriter is incredible, the writing fits perfectly.

Perhaps it was an exercise in diminished expectations and/or studiously avoiding any trailers or spoilers for 'Matrix: Revolutions', but I walked out of the movie feeling exhilerated and entertained... and more than a little puzzled by the large number of critics who received this movie badly.

Unlike its predecessor, this movie felt both accessible and well-paced. Sure, there was a hint of the metaphysical and philosophical BS which brought 'Reloaded' down a couple of notches, but it was not overly heavy handed. Gone were the Merovingian's overly long speeches on causality and the lingering sweaty rave in the Temple of Zion; in 'Revolutions' the material seems relevant.

The visuals are striking and the action, when it gets going, is relentless and interesting. If you liked the first movie but were somewhat let down by the second, you may find the third to be a redemption for the Wachowskis and a fitting end to the series.

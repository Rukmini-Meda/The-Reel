 Like some of the other posters, I cannot believe some of the good reviews this film has gotten. Based on the classic novel by Victor Hugo, the entire story is told with music - and spectacularly boring music it is, at that. Any high school kid (with or without a music background) could come up with stuff like this. Anne Hathaway sings well, Russell Crowe (famously) does not. He has the range of a bull moose snorting angrily through a foghorn. Most of the cast try really hard with this material, but major plot points are obscured (or ignored) by poor writing. It is never a good idea to render an entire story, with all its dialog, in music. If you don't want every detail shouted at you in feverish pitch, avoid this thing like the plague. I kept waiting for this to get better - and it never, ever did. The production values are OK, but the whole thing seems endlessly long, and by the end, I was just waiting for the whole mess to be over! Don't waste your time - see the wonderful 1930s version (no music there, thank God) with Fredric March and Charles Laughton (as the evil inspector). A true classic, that was.

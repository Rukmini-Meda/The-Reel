 Les Miserables. Such an incredible story overall. The book is long and complex and all of that but this certain adaptation was just okay. The main reason being that I don't think that this ensemble cast could tell the story the way they did without singing. The Musical aspect made the film. Without the singing i think the film would be horrid. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway were phenomenal as well as the young girl Amanda Seyfried, boy can she sing. Also I didn't like the young man they chose for Marius, Eddie Redmayne, could have easily found a better choice. Although lots of the movie was hard to focus on, such as the Directing. I don't know Tom Hooper very well but i do respect him for this movie and The King's Speech. I did especially love the cinematography, it fit perfectly with the story. When i read the story this year in school i was able to subtly imagine the words in my head. I feel as though this movie is how most if not everyone sees the words when read. The adapted screenplay seemed easy to adapt into a film, since it was a play even before the film. And though I have read the book, this ending still nearly made me cry. Of course they took some parts out of the book but the minimal amount of. It was a good okay film but i expected more. I understand that it is a sad story of sorrow and new love. But in the end i feel like the main grasped conflict was sadness. I would've loved to see more internal conflict shown through production and acting. I consider this movie at par.

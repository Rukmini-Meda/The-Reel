 With no money to buy food and his niece facing death by starvation, "Jean Valjean" (Hugh Jackman) decides to steal a loaf of bread from a nearby store. Unfortunately, he is caught and sentenced to 5 years at hard labor. During this time he attempts to escape more than once and each time his sentence is lengthened. Eventually, after 19 years in prison he is finally released on parole. Unable to find a job he steals from a church but is once again caught. But this time fate smiles at him as the local priest gives him total absolution and he is allowed to depart with the stolen goods. Ashamed for his actions he decides to start a new life and tears up his parole papers as a sign of his determination. However, having done so he now becomes a wanted criminal and a certain law enforcement official named "Javert" (Russell Crowe) is determined to find him regardless of what it takes. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that it follows the book quite faithfully. That said it's rather long (158 minutes) and a large portion of it is performed in song. A very large portion. Even so most of it was quite entertaining and I recommend it to those who enjoy musicals of this type. Above average.

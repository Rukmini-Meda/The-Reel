 This fictionalised take on the life of one of the most talented composers of all time is what I would describe as a once in geneneration film. F.Murray Abraham portrays the religious and sceptical Italian composer Antonio Salieri , who does nothing to hide his jealousy for the former child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Salieri's bitterness towards Mozart yet his unwavering admiration for his talent cause Salieri to question his own faith, believing God to be mocking him for his own mediocrity. It's this developing rivalry that keeps viewers entertained throughout the film as Mozart grapples with alcoholism, his father's death, writing the Magic Flute and his crippling financial situation. We are constantly led to believe that it is Salieri who is such a negative influence on Mozart, eventually leading yo the composers unexplained death at the age of 35. He was writing the Requiem at the time of his death and it is shown that Salieri finishes it for him. The film then ends leaving us to ponder over whether it was Salieri who killed Mozart or if it was God who reclaimed his "Beloved", in reference to the Italian meaning of the film's title. This film is truly one of the great 20th Century dramas.

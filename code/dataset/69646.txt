I read a lot of bad reviews about this movie saying it had nothing to offer but CGI. Then I read a few reviews praising this and I thought they came from people who were part of the movie production team; however, after watching it I realized that a 5.8 rating does not do this movie justice. It easily deserves a 7 on IMDb. I think some aspects of the movie could be compared to Thor. Thor was definitely much more enjoyable than this. I reckon the main reason this movie is not rated as highly as Thor is that unlike Thor, the characters in this movie are rather one dimensional and you never really get to know or care about them much. The entire movie is like you're watching it from a third person perspective, which is not as engaging as it could have been had the characters been given more screen time and a richer back story. There is plenty of CGI action and grand scenes here. The CGI is passable, but it had the potential to be much better than this, considering the fact that it constitutes a major part of this movie.

I would say people, who are not too critical, enjoy Greek mythology in general, have a penchant for a storyline that is straightforward and easy to follow, and of course love to see lots of action, well designed CGI creatures, fantastic vast CGI landscapes, and do not mind seeing one dimensional characters and a predictable ending and look for entertainment and pure fun rather than an intelligent plot, will definitely enjoy this movie a lot, as did I. I have to admit the monsters in this movie were some of the strangest looking and creatively designed I have seen in a long time. I am considering getting the 3D version. A movie with so much fantastic CGI is bound to look great in 3D even if I am to see it in my 40 inch 3D Sony Bravia TV and not in a theater.

I recommend this movie to people who want to be highly entertained. Final verdict: 8

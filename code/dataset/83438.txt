In honor of the fourth of May ,the official Star Wars day I will start reviewing the prequels, ow boy this going to be ruff. Nowadays is easy to see how bad the Phantom Menance is but when it first came out, it was 16 years after a Star Wars movie was in the big scene, so everyone old Force users and young links were exacted for the continuation of this epic saga. Then they saw the flick and the backlash was an epic one and rightfully so. In case and point, the cgi are ugly to put it polite, the majority of the characters are either racist stereotypes like Jar Jar Bing (curse to be!) ,boring like Padme Amidala or both and for the case of the Jedi council ,which is useless, I mean a PLANET is under foreign occupation by one of senate members and they just do nothing. Why? You are consider to be the protector of the Galaxit Rebuplic and you have the Force. Understood if you can not sent the whole Jedi membership ,but sent at least more than two people when the situation goes to hell. To add to that the battle of Naboo is a CGI mess,they tried to do again the battle of Endor, and we get a CGI mess and a boring (if that is possible) Space Battle, in Star Wars!! The only good things are Liam Neeson performance, the pod racing and Darth Maul, this three small bits proved the Menance to become unwatchable. I do not recommended for any reason ,but to see how underwhelming it is.

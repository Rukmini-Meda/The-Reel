This movie is way better than Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, come on guys can't you see? It's so obvious and so hard. Hayden Christensen's acting, best acting i have ever seen(If you know what i mean). There is a great plot twist that you can't even imagine.

Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's well: It's Star Wars. 10 stars out of 10.

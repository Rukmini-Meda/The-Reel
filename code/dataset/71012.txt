I was kind of late I watching this, I actually watched in 2013 on DVD. I must warn people who have OCD, this movie probably isn't for you.

So, my take on this movie is very cool CGI effects, cool sounds and you see building collapsing, volcanoes eroding and all that but in all honesty, beyond that - the movie itself is as many people say "a disaster".

What I found really unnecessary was Tamara's death. How let alone being really pretty, they just left her and forgot about her, showed nothing recovering her body at the end. She had screamed the top of her lungs going through that death. That was just too disturbing. It's a no- brainer as to why Emmerich wrote for Yuri and Gordon to die, but Tamara and Sasha - unnecessary. That would have been good drama to add.

This movie is just sad, like an ex-con who was in prison so long, his first instinct is to deep throat the straw of his refreshing beverage. The cast of The Expendables can be divided neatly in three parts, past their prime action heroes, brown people, and Jason Statham. Somebody please tell Sylvester Stallone that he is too old for this s@#t, no matter how many face lifts he gets or how much hGH is coursing through his veins. It's really pathetic how many 65 year old men are trying to relive their youth as John McClane these days. What are they gonna in the next one, attach gatling guns to Stallone's walker. Back when everybody was wearing leg-warmers, hanging in 50's themed diners, and doing cocaine, a movie like this would've been ''totally awesome'', but now it's just pitiable.

Maybe the problem is that this film was aimed directly at 80's action movie fans and I have never liked them. The Expendables with it's choreographed martial arts and climactic orgy of explosions, fails to impress. I guess the hardcore violence in this flick was cool, but if all I wanted was violence I would have just payed a couple of homeless people to fight. That would have been live entertainment and probably cheaper than the price of admission. "

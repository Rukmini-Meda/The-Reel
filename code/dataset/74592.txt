"2012" is actually one of the best disaster movies to date in my opinion. Sure it had a very generic and predictable storyline, but the visual effects outshines all other disaster movies. And that alone makes it well-worth watching this movie.

And as a disaster movie then impressive and realistic visuals are everything. And the special effects team were really delivering more than expected. It was almost as if the audience was right there in the mayhem, chaos and destruction.

Story-wise, well, then "2012" was as every other disaster movie ever made. Mankind stares total annihilation in the face and stands triumphant against impossible odds. Yes, a very generic storyline and one that has been used countless other times in just about every other disaster movie.

They had put together quite a good cast for the movie. Of course it was Woody Harrelson who outshines everyone with his performance as the oddball Charlie. But I will also say that John Cusack did quite well in this movie, despite being well out of his usual arena of movie genres. Oliver Platt was also quite good in this given role.

I have seen this movie a couple of times already, and every time I am equally blown away by the impressive CGI effects that are shown in "2012". This movie is a definite must watch for any fan of the disaster movie genre.

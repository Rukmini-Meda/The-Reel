My Personal Rating 10/10 - This film is an timeless classic masterpiece. The Acting the soundtrack the atmosphere the cinematography almost everything on this film is unbelievably perfect, i never saw anything like that in my history of watching movies. the more time you watch this movie the more you will love it, that's what i exactly did. This is my personal favorite movie yet, but it might not be a movie for everyone though.

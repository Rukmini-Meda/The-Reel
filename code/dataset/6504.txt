The previous two Matrix movies were a lot better than this one. The action scene's weren't nearly as good as the previous two and the ending was pretty bad. Its a pity they didn't make this movie better as now it downgrades the whole Matrix series.

There was too much time in Zion - when they should have spent more time in the Matrix. The final battle was all right but the way it ended wasn't good. I still don't understand it fully! The movie wasn't horrible - but I was just expecting so much more.

If your a matrix fan - you should definitely watch this (you don't want to have the series uncompleted) even if the movie isn't great.

6/10 - an average movie.

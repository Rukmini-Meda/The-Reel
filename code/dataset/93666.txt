 I read a lot of bad reviews unfortunately these people are right on the money. You don't have to be a film geek to see how bad this movie is. I honestly miss the old action movies where there is an actual build up to the action so that the action feels intense. The film makers of today need to realize that less is more. No good one liners. They really need to expand on the characters. Jet li was a great action star and they just made him look like a bitch in this movie. I remember when Steve Austin was great in Predator in this movie he couldn't have been more generic. And the action ...geeez I literally fast forwarded the last sequence because it was so boring. Arnold just felt and looked like a wrinkly puppet who's appearance really had no significance at all in the movie. At the end turns out Gunner was alive? and they were all just getting along splendidly like he didn't try to kill them or betray them? Wow.

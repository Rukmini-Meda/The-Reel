As an action movie to me it was just one of many others. It didn't stand out on any way. Lots and lots of shooting just like it should be... but some of the scenes to me was disturbing, and a little more violent that i was comfortable on.

The camera working was awful, some scenes was not clear and no idea who hit who.

I also would love that Willis and Schwarzenegger would show in the movie more than just a little.

Stallone made an excellent role in this movie!

For a one night movie it was nice, but i will not watch it again and in half year i will not even remember that i have watched it.

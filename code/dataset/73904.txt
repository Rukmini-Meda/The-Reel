 This movie has some scenes of action but its still boring I mean come on! I did not understand none of it something to do with god or some sizzle It did not make no sense and was so awful I nearly cried of boredom. The only reason I watched it was because my friend said 'It's my favourite movie of all time' but after making all his mates watch it (who all thought it was rubbish and dull) It is no longer his favourite movie anymore The Avengers is now. It drags the boring plot on about some guy who we don't even care, who is about as interesting as watching paint dry. I couldn't care less if he saved the planet or some flying town I don't know, I don't get it. Don't watch this movie it's a waste of time. Only watch it if you have infinite time to waste.

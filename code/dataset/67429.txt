Okay this movie didn't totally suck, but in my point of view it wasn't great either. I hoped the movie would be more like RED, because then I liked it.

I didn't like the script, the one-liners weren't even that great. I hope for some cheesy one-liners after a big fight or a big boom, but it fell flat to the ground. I really question the intelligence of some people in this film, like Gunner. He's totally nuts and he doesn't make sense. First he is good, then he tried to kill Yin Yang and in the end he is good again and everybody accepted him, while he was kicked out in the beginning ?! It's just silly and stupid.

I also find it very weird that Arnold Swarzenegger and Bruce Willis where on the front of the DVD case. They made a 3 minute appearance ?! like what the hell, they are not even that important, more like: I show my face then we can get paid and more people will go to the movie.

The special effects where meh. It was so obviously fake it wasn't even funny... While we where an hour in the movie I could feel my thoughts drifting away and before I know it I was thinking about other stuff en 'missed' 30 minutes of the movie. But I didn't miss it, really, because when I was back again it was still the same fighting when I drifted away.

I eventually gave it a six, because it wasn't entirely bad, but it isn't my movie. I think I will skip the expendables 2 and directly move on to expendables 3, because it is almost in cinemas here.

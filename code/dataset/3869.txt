 I am truly torn on what to rate this movie.. as a stand alone movie it was about a 5 maybe a 3 at best... however if you went to see or buy this movie with the original one in mine I would have to give it a 1 ... because the two movies had absolutely nothing in common other then the title in my eyes.. They totally rewrote the story to the point that other then some of the characters names it had zero in common. To be honest I also think they it was not written as well as the original. it is mostly the special effects that carried it the acting was not terrible but it wasn't good either. I believe all in all I can sum it up with a simple sentence if you are going to do a rewrite at least improve upon the original.

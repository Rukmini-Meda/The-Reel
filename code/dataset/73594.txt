If I were to rate this movie strictly on science or believability it would be a 2, but ultimately I found 2012 to be rather entertaining. The CGI was superb throughout, and surprisingly the acting was OK, but the story itself was not so hot and very overdone. If you want scenes of total devastation and cataclysm this outing will thrill you, for the CGI is superb and almost terrifyingly realistic.

While the story itself is lacking, you can at least relate it to the headlines in the news sometimes. It is the ultimate disaster movie no doubt, and if you leave your cape of reality at home you can enjoy it thoroughly...

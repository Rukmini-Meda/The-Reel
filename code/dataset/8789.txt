Personally, even though I like musicals and being a musician myself, I thought there was just way too much singing in this movie.

Not to knock the fantastic job the whole cast did. I know Hugh Jackman spent around 14 hours a day singing in shooting for this film, and all the main characters are just stellar at it. (Who knew Russell Crowe could sing a lick, much less do such a good job at it?)

I just have a problem in that music - and not all that linear. Some of the lyrics' structures are pretty out there, especially when several stories intertwine, you can't understand a thing - is being used as a CONSTANT vehicle to tell the story, rather than highlight key moments in the drama. For my taste, I just feel the narrative of the story gets gently swept away in all that music, as I do feel the movie would benefit so much more from more constant, traditional storytelling without all that musical weight.

But on the flip side, it is a dream cast, every actor is pitch perfect - no pun intended - in their role, the sets and wardrobe are outstanding and Tom Hooper does an amazing job is portraying the griminess of it all, when need be. (Though I could do without some of the independent-y "alternative" looking shots scattered throughout)

Absolutely no knock on the movie as a whole. Everyone does a wonderful job. For me, it's really just a matter of taste.

An easy 8 out of 10.

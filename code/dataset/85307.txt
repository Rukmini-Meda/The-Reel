This movie was not that bad at all. The story was great, but it was not satisfying in relation to the Kraken. It was hyped up to be the destroyer of all destroyers, and the one that could defeat the Gods. But shortly after it was summoned, it was defeated.

Despite the two minute Kraken, there were some creatures that were pretty awesome. Medusa was intense with her death stare. The giant scorpions were ferocious with their attack.

Zeus, played by Liam Neeson, wore an outfit that was hard on the eyes. It was way too bright. There should have been more of Zeus throughout the movie.

Les Mis is simply one of the greatest musicals ever put to stage. It's one of the longest running shows in Broadway history and is always getting revived on the Great White Way. This version.....ehhhhh

Okay, okay, the good: *Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" sequence. I'm sure you've heard about this: it's all done in one take, the shot is kept close and intimate and Hathaway's performance just knocks it out of the park.

*Samatha Barks--Her Eponine is pretty great. She has an amazing voice and you can see her theatrical training coming through.

The Okay: *Hugh Jackman. I may getting plenty of dislikes for this but here it is. I love Jackman, he's a terrific Wolverine, he's fun, he throws himself into whatever he's working on. But ...he's just not the right choice for Valjean, I'm sorry, he's not. Valjean is a part clearly written for a legit tenor and Jackman is a baritone. You can hear it on Valjean's most famous number, "Bring Him Home". Jackman hits the notes but it's clearly a stretch and not where his voice wants to naturally sit.

The Bad: *Russell Crowe. Yeah, you knew this was coming. Russell Crowe, Russell Crowe. What the HELL were you doing in this movie? To his credit, he is in tune and he does know how to sing a musical phrase. But his STYLE of singing is so incredibly wrong, he's been the butt of a million jokes ever since the movie came out. Yeah, this just has to be one of the worst casting decisions made in cinema history.

*Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne. This is another one I might catch flack for. So be it. Seyfried has an INCREDIBLY distracting vibrato and Redmayne sounds like Kermit the Frog. I'm sorry, he does. Plus, the latter's performance of "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"...it just swings and misses. This is one of the big emotional moments of the show, Marius dealing with just this massive amount of survivor's guilt. In the show, I've seen actors tear at their clothes and hair and throw themselves down on their knees as they rage, "Oh my friends, my friends! Don't ask me what your sacrifice was for!!" And then as the music plays its last soulful notes, break down into open sobbing. Here, Redmayne just sits in a chair and looks pouty. It just doesn't serve the show well at all.

*The constant close-ups. In some scenes, like Hathaway's solo, they serve the movie well. But they are just way over used. The director looks very unimaginative in his choice of cinematography. The places you're taking us are fascinating--how about pulling the shot back so we can see some of them?

*Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonhem Carter. I'm sorry, I'm just tired of their....let's call it "Burton-ing". We seen it before, we'll see it again. They're not the worse part of the movie, by far (that's probably Crowe) but it's just so distracting.

So ....yeah, moments of the movie were good but as a whole, you can tell they just went with as many famous names as they could get and while some did an adequate job, you get the feeling there must have been better choices for a lot of the key roles (Javert, adult Cosette, Marius). If you get a chance to see it on Broadway, by all means, go and see it. You won't be disappointed. But this .....siiiiiggghhhh. You'll just have to take the good with the bad, I'm afraid.

I cannot understand why many people rated this movie so low? they compared it to The Day After Tomorrow.. but the stories are entirely different. They are DIFFERENT in their own way! DAT is based on severe Climate Change. But that effects only parts of the world, There are ways for humans to survive. This movie is based on the Ancient Mayan Civilisations predictions for the date 2012. The emissions from the Sun has an effect on the earth-core which leaves practically nowhere for any type of species to survive. The fight for survival is much more intense in this movie.

I'm a big fan of DAT, I watched it 3 times! but 2012 definitely brings a lot more to the table... in terms of Visual Effects, the unique story, the way the Characters all tie in with one another. Yes, there are some miraculous escapes, but it's a movie.. if they made it 100% realistic all humans would be dead. That wouldn't make it a fun movie to watch now would it?.

Movies tend to do far-fetched things sometimes, thats what makes it interesting and sometimes even funny... i laughed so much when I saw them land at the right place at the right time, but thats what makes it entertaining too. If they died, that wouldn't make it much of a story.

I put off watching the movie, because of the bad reviews for such a long time... but after I watched it, I thought it was much better than people had given it credit for... watch it, and you might just be surprised.

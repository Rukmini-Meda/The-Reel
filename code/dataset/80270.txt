After patiently viewing all 2 hours & 40 minutes of this mega-disaster picture called 2012, I'm now completely convinced that German-born director, Roland Emmerich, totally hates the USA with a burning passion like no other.

With each subsequent disaster film that Emmerich has directed, he's made a point of destroying the States that much more. Until now, with 2012, there's literally nothing at all left of America to destroy. It's all gone, bye-bye.

And, I say, "Thank goodness for that."

By that, I mean, I hope that with 2012 Emmerich has finally gotten this hateful wrath of his towards the USA cleared right out of his system. And I hope that this will be the very last time that he goes to such extreme lengths (in one of his movies) as a means to get his hateful point across.

If you ask me, I find all of Emmerich's obsession with mass destruction not only screwy, but utterly tiresome, as well.

And, on top of all of that, I absolutely resent the blatant product placement which never fails to make its unwelcome way into just about every one of Emmerich's pictures.

In my opinion, all that these advertising plugs do is completely reduce said-film to the point of being nothing but an extended commercial, meant solely to showcase the consumer products that are conveniently being flashed in front of our faces.

All-in-all - 2012 was a truly terrible Noah's Ark story which actually seemed to be bent on turning all of the death & destruction (that it gleefully featured) into some sort of a perverse joke.

And, let's face it, as lame as this film's humour clearly was, no amount of cheap, Buddhist philosophy is ever going to be the answer for saving this world of ours.

*Note* - For anyone who's interested - Out of 2012's $200 million budget, Emmerich's modest cut was only $70 million.

I went into this movie unsure of what to expect. As someone who had seen the stage production three times, I was worried that the movie would ruin Les Mis for me and it would not seem right as a film. I was proved to be wrong.

From the first song, I was hooked. The dramatic scenes, costumes, makeup and acting really worked well to set the scene and give an emotional appeal. I found that the film did a great job of giving the story something a stage production couldn't have much of, close ups and setting. I found the setting really added a lot to the film and it was something I really enjoyed.

Now, onto the actors. Starting with Hugh Jackman, I thought he was great for the role of Jean Vajean. The way he looked and acted was very good. However, although his acting was very good, I felt that at times he did not have quite the vocal abilities. An example is during the song, Who Am I. He spoke more than sang and did not hold the notes long enough. However, the emotional delivery of that song was spectacular.

As many said, Anne Hathaway was very fitting. She had a great singing voice and put her heart and soul into the character. Although Russel Crowe was widely criticised for not being a good singer, he really portrayed Javert very well and his singing was not terrible. It did lack power in some areas, but he was good overall.

Eddie Redmayne gave by far the best delivery of any solo song in the entire movie. he had great facial expressions during the closeups and his singing and delivery was amazing. Amanda Seyfried's singing voice was also beautiful. It was high but not ear piercing and she really portrayed the beautiful and dainty Cosette very well.

Overall, I really enjoyed Les Miserables and probably cried about ten times throughout. It is definitely a must see for fans.

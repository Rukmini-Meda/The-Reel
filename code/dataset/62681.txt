What else can be said. This classic movie is a must see for anyone interested in "older" films, "classic" films, and otherwise "darn good" films. The acting us superb. I have watched this film at least a dozen times over the years, and see something new every time.

My suggestion is to "leave the gun" and "eat the cannoli" while you watch this indescribably good movie.

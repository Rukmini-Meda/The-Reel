Here are the good things about Phantom Menace:

Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman all showed great acting chops as Qui-Gonn, Obi-Wan, and Padme respectively. In addition, Ray Park did a good job as Darth Maul.

The lightsaber duels were impeccably choreographed, and the CG wasn't the worst.

Now, the bad parts, they will be listed in ascending order of how bad they were:

1) Midi-Chlorians: look, its not a bad call, but George could have been a lot more creative.

2) The subtle racism of Watto and the Trade Federation. NOT COOL.

3) Jake Lloyd may have been young, but choose a better actor. For the love of the Force, I would have even preferred a young Hayden Christiansen.

4) Jar-Jar. For the love of God, please no. This would have been acceptable under two possible circumstances. 1, he just wasn't there. or 2, the Jar-Jar Sith lord theory holds true, which would have in fact, made this move by George really creative.

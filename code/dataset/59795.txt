The only thing that let's this film down is the science. Ignore that and it's a very enjoyable film. I saw this not long after it's release but enjoyed it more the second time around when i wasn't expecting much from the experience but was pleasantly surprised.

Just accept the earth has a very big problem, sit back and enjoy the show!

Top notch action sequences and effects are worth the 8 out of 10 I've chosen to give this film. I was quite surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat a few times and engaged to the end.

I put this film on to be entertained and entertained i was!

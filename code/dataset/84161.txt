I guess the only reason I was interested in seeing this was because it was the last (or one of the last) movies to ever be reviewed on Siskel and Ebert or Ebert and Roeper or Roeper or whatever. I really didn't need to know anything about the plot at all, given that it was just a movie about a bunch of action stars getting together and blowing stuff up. That's what I thought I was getting and that's exactly what I got. There actually is a major complaint I have. The most famous star of all was Arnold Schwarzenegger and he barely appears in the film at all! I mean, I thought he'd at least appear at the end to rescue everybody.

That really did annoy me. Even Bruce Willis didn't have much screen time. So, this movie features a bunch of action scenes and killing in all sorts of ways. The action was decent, but there just wasn't anything that good about the characters. It especially got cliched at the end when they were talking about how the hero and villain were similar and everything. I guess I like the settings. It's just really nothing you haven't seen in many other action movies. I heard Eric Roberts was the most prolific actor out there and it was nice to see him in this movie. **1/2

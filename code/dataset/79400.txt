I know I missed like the first five minutes of the film, but could anyone tell me where the hell are the Titans in this film? I mean they're in the damn title!

Apart from this obvious and annoying error, I enjoyed the film. I don't say it was the best, or something that can be watched many times, but it's good fun. Great action, even better music and some great actors posing as gods. Sam Worthington is a good action star, Gemma Arterton isn't a bad sight and the special effects were over the top.

Now that I listed the good things, let's move on to the bad ones: the story is lame. Furthermore, it sucks. But if you just watch the bright pictures, and listen to the sounds, you might as well enjoy this movie. When I watch a film, I tend to focus on the good things, and that is why I liked this one. I ignored the sloppy writing and let myself flow with the random action.

It's obviously nothing like 300, but it's definitely less boring then Troy. If you like these kind of movies I'd recommend it, but it doesn't worth your money. If it's in TV you should check it out.

"Slow zoom on the desert, there's flags evil guy-CUT!" if you know what this is, you're cool.

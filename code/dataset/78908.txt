I still remember when this movie came out, everyone was talking about it. It was one of the highest grossing films of all time. The graphics blew everyone's mind. Yeah, it just didn't really do anything for me. I agree, the graphics are stunning. If you want to get sucked into this world with the CGI and the animation of all the animals, go see this movie because you will be pleased. But the reason this didn't really work for me is the story. It's a story that's been seen a million times before. Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas did this story, and it was old back then. I know a lot of people really liked this movie for it's graphics, but personally I have to be engrossed in the story to be engrossed in the movie. I also think that the villains were weakly developed. They're just the generic bad buys. So personally I'm not a fan, but that doesn't mean you won't be.

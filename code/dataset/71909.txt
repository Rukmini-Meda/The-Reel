First the only thing that really grates with me: the heavy American accents are a distraction and clearly undesirable in a movie principally about Italian and German composers.

But to moan about that would be to overlook a simply magnificent film, one with the dramatic scope and scale of a grand opera, told through the unreliable recollections of Salieri at the end of his life. Great credit to the director (Forman), actors (especially Abraham, one of very few actors to deserve his Best Actor Oscar outright for the performance given), the city of Prague for recreating Vienna so beautifully, to Sir Neville Marriner for the best soundtrack of all time, and to Schaffer for a script that tells a powerful story in such a spellbinding fashion, artfully weaving fact and the fictions of Salieri.

Put simply, Amadeus will always be among my top 3 movies of all time, with good reason. If you haven't already seen it, don't delay by so much as a minute!!

 I watched the movie in a theater and have to say that I enjoyed it. Especially the special effects and the well created fight scenes are favorable. Thought, the plot could have been more and better developed, but it is OK for a 106 minutes movie. Other critics remain mostly on the uncompleted story of Perseus. The movie contains just some scenes from the written myth and his journey to the Medusa. The actors provided an impressive acting, especially Ralph Fiennes who played Hades. The movie starts very promising with strong and symbolic action scenes and stays interesting and action packed until the end. I recommend to watch it on a big screen and digital surround.

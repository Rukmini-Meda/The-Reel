This movie should spark our connection to Mother Earth, even if it is to show how all things a connected; everything that is in the Earth is in us, the human being, we are so much a part, yet we are hell bent on doing just the same thing the miners are doing on Pandora, "Greed is good!", I ask, is it? or should we say, "We have taken so much from Mother Earth, now, what can we give back to heal the wounds man has created!

Films like Avatar do indeed show mankind for what they are, well, some of us; we have watched this film 4 times at home and twice at the cinema, the common factor is greed, but as in this great film, we who care, can do our part in an ending which is epitomized in this remarkable film!

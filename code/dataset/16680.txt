AVATAR This movie seems to me so excellent, in addition to its good graphics has a good history developed to tell. No doubt is the highest grossing films of James Cameron with the original idea of a new World with extreme conditions and people adapted, It show the Rivaly between the human race and races created into the movies, this idea hasn't been unique but definitely not lost its charm. In my Opinion the only negative things is its long running time to film, James said that is due to the development and innovation of modern graphics that will not go down in history as fast, considering that it would be an extraordinary film should have a unique graphic, not only based in the graphics but it seems to me is one of the few movies that combine action with a story without mistakes. Certainly it was one of the best movies that i have seen ever and I highly recommended.

I am very big fan of American films and movies. However, I really think the American movie or film makers should stop making these movies such as "2012". We have already have so many similar movie and films just like "2012" with the same theme, story line, predicted out come and acting, and more. These movies and films are all set in the great USA and made by American movie or film makes. Please do discover something new to show your fans, please stop being so self-centred.

For now, my self and the world are becoming bored of these similar style disaster movies and films. "2012" is so similar to other American disaster films and movies that I predicted the whole outcome from start to finish. It was like in making this movie, they took so many bits from other American disaster movies and put them together to make "2012". The whole world know that London Great Britain was the centre of attention for hosting "London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games" for the Summer of the year 2012, yet London was only mention and focus on for one second, that was all. How, so self-centred can the American film and movie makes be, this is not good.

"2012" could have been so much more a better movie if only the writer or writers had bother to do there research more better.The only good thing about "2012" is that the were some world class famous actors in the movie, but even that is really see as predictable.

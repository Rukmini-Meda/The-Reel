Lovely movie.There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive Just got back from my second viewing of Avatar in the stunning Max 3D and it was even better this time around. I won't go into the story line as you probably already have an idea of this and i don't want to add any spoilers. The storyline itself is simple but not unintelligent and keeps you gripped from start to finish. There is lots of action, battle scenes, sci fie, and a love story to keep you occupied. The special effects are amazing and the attention to detail is brilliant but this is not just a Fox showpiece like 2012 was, there is depth to avatar. I just could not see how anyone could dislike this, the 2 and a half hours drifted by and left me wanting more. James Cameron truly is a master of movies.Same based on India lord "Hanuman Ji".Perfect movie.Must watch guys

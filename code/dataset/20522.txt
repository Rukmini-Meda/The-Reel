The movie as a whole was a memorable experience. Personally I saw it as a metaphor for what the western world calls "third world". The "Pandoran" people did not want a thing that developed countries had, and western people didn't understand that, so they thought of them as unintelligent beings that talk to their trees.

The CGI was amazing and I usually despise the use of CGI. The world was awe-inspiring but the rest was just mediocre.

The acting was horrible. The only actor that acted their role correctly was Zoe Saldana, she was great throughout the whole film. The writing was similar to an Adam Sandler movie and the music was as generic as a musical score can get.

It still is a must-watch film, because of the gorgeous world they created. But not necessarily a must-watch-till-the-end.

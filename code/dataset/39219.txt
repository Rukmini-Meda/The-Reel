This movie is my favorite! It has amazing special effects and jaw-dropping 3D shots! The world of Pandora is amazing with beautiful scenery and includes landscapes that defy gravity. Amazing action sequences include robots that probably inspired Pacific Rim, not to mention large battles and warfare as well. Last but not least, their is tight romance that explodes at a tense point. Overall, this movie is James Cameron's best work in motion, and a critical darling as well.

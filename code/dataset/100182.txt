First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely .

It is the best movie ever made in Hollywood . Probably the best movie on the previous century . It indicates how important can be a family bond . Vito Corleone's quotes - I gonna make him an offer he can't refuse made him more special to me .

 Who gives this less than an eight? Maybe because of Russell Crowe trying to sing but you know what....good for him. He went out of his element and put himself on the national stage by taking a leap. Which one of us wouldn't take a leap for something we wouldn't want to do. I also don't believe in God yet I love this movie. Music is fantastic. Anne Hathaway is fantastic, Aaron Tveit is fantastic. Hugh Jackman can sing and act his heart out. My girlfriend had been recommending this musical for a long time and I simply dismissed her ideas- after all what guy likes singing and musicals and history? After recommending this to my friends...all giant sports and non-musical fans...we found ourselves talking about it on Superbowl Sunday. This movie is highly recommended to anyone.

As breathtaking as Amadeus is, not everyone will like it. Everybody will agree the acting as a whole, and by Abraham and Hulce alone, are top notch but there are some people that hate opera, can't stand classical music and will laugh too hard at the outfits. Luckily, I am not one of those people. The acting is always the one thing I pay attention to the most, all other film aspects follow soon after. But with this, the sets and costumes are so good, you can't take your eyes off the screen. You are suckered into seeing a cast of fine actors, with two underrated actors named F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce leading the group. Even if people don't like classic or opera, the way that they are placed in this is sure to blow the viewer away. There is one scene where Salieri (Abraham) plays a fine composition then gives Mozart (Hulce) to critique. Mozart likes it, but makes it even a better piece in an instant. No matter the viewer, they will find that bit really cool.

Amadeus tells the fictional story of talented composer, Antonio Salieri in an insane asylum who claims to have killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. When they were kids, Salieri always liked Mozart's music and has always been jealous of him. His envy grows the older they get and swears revenge, not knowing Mozart already has a lot on his plate. Salieri attempts to destroy Mozart by any means necessary.

In classic take of jealousy and revenge, Abraham gives a white-knuckling performance as one of the the screen's evilest and craziest villains. Tom Hulce's portrayal as Mozart is comical and haunting, funny one minute and serious the next. Not sure if Mozart really was like this, but Hulce gives one of those few instances where a comical character can be serious and Oscar- worthy. The music, sets, and costumes do fabulous jobs in enhancing an already fine movie experience.

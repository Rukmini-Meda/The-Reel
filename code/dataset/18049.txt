There's little to dislike about LES MISERABLES, an exemplary staging of the long-running West End musical featuring a lavish budget, all-star cast and some great vocals. It's a tale of love and loss, of obsession and hatred played out against the background of revolutionary France, and it's quite simply the best musical to come along for a good few years.

Much of the delight comes from the central pairing of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, both of whom are better than they've been for a good while. Each actors gives it his all, and they fill their roles with nobility, honour and feeling. I like the supporting cast less - Anne Hathaway is nothing to write home about in my mind, and didn't really deserve that Oscar - but Amanda Seyfried is better than she was in MAMMA MIA and Eddie Redmayne is reliable as always.

As a film, LES MISERABLES looks splendid, and THE KING'S SPEECH director Tom Hooper puts every penny of the budget up on screen. The songs are memorable and very well sung by the entire cast, and although I could have done without Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (both of whom seem to be repeating their parts from SWEENEY TODD) they're not too off-putting. Certainly LES MISERABLES is a winner and one to be rewatched and enjoyed all over again in future years.

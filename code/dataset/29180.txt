Kind of stinks.

There is one great scene where Crowe comes up with his economic plan by trying to pick up women at a bar....but beyond that, it sort of stinks.

The fault is mainly with Crowe and Connolly. Connolly has always had a hard time emoting and Crowe really only plays Crowe aide from the rare movie like "The Insider." The director did a great job aside of the lead, but really we have Crowe playing Crowe thinking he is the greatest actor on earth and, really, he should be playing John Nash.

John Nash doesn't really make an appearance in the film at all, it is all Crowe and that just doesn't work for a biopic.

Any other actor and it would have been as great as the fans make it out to be.

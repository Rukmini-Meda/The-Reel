"The Matrix Revolutions" is the last movie of "The Matrix" trilogy and I think that this movie is the worst of this trilogy according to the two others. After I have seen the first movie of this trilogy which I found it simply magnificent and the second one which I also liked it very much came the third to ruined them all.

As you can understand I did not like it as I liked the two previous movies of this trilogy and I have to say that I expected from that. I think that Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss made a really great interpretations, but this time they were not enough.

Finally I believe that this movie is one of the worst endings for a such a trilogy and I can compare how bad it was with the "Spiderman 3" movie which I think that it was not the ending that everyone expected to be such in this movie.

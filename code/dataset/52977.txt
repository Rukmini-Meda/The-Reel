This is a very rich film in all levels. It has an entertaining story, amazing visual effects, and it is rich in political, social and religious symbolism. However, it lost two stars because of the relatively predictable storyline and conventional characters.

After four years of the film, many articles and studies have been written about the film's religious symbolism and relationship with Hinduism etc. However, I was surprised that nobody (as far as I searched) noticed that the attack of Colonel Quaritch to destroy Na'vi holiest site "the tree of souls" resembles the very well-known story in the Arab and Muslim history of the attack of Abraha The ruler of Yemen to destroy the Arab's most sacred site "Kaaba" in city Mecca around year 570. As it is depicted in Muslim history, Abraha led a massive army which was headed by an elephant. His aim was to destroy Arab's spiritual centre so that he can rule them. Abraha's attack failed because the "nature" has acted in favour of the defence of Kaaba where the elephant and horses in Abraha's army refused to enter Mecca, and enormous group of birds attacked the army by throwing stones on them. This story is important for Muslims since it was mentioned in the Quran and reaffirms the sacredness of Mecca.

In the avatar film, the attack of Colonel Quartich had the same objective: to destroy Na'vi spiritual centre, and it failed for the same reason: nature has acted. Eywa (the Na'vi Goddess) triggered an attack by Pandora's animals against the army both on the ground and in the sky. In fact, the attack of Tendrils and Toruks (the flying animals) scene reminded me instantly of the story of birds attacking Abraha's army. Even what Neytiri said to Jake "Eywa heard you", resembles what Abdul-Muttalib (Mecca's leader and the Grandfather of Muslim's prophet Muhammad) said: Kaaba will be protected by God.

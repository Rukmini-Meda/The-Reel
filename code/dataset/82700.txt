 I recently watched the original again after almost three decades because, as a child, it captured my imagination. Seeing it a few months ago it seemed very cheesy and dated with a low budget, in short a true B-movie. And it was so boring I couldn't watch it all, but had to fast forward to the battle scenes. The remake on the other hand has fantastic CGI, the battles were nicely done, acting was OK, story was straight forward, in short it was an entertaining movie, for it delivered what it promised. The only thing I didn't like was the main hero who seemed out of place -he looked and acted like a jock or a street gang member in the 21st century. The actor in the original did a much better job. I wrote this review because many people negatively compare the new version to the 1981 version, which was a cheese festival.

The first time I saw the trailer for this movie I was immediately interested. And this movie exceeded my expectations. With a story that is easy to understand but very intriguing. Plus stunning image results and the results were very mature CGI. Plus a very skilled actor playing a character each. At the end of the story I never thought that Jake Sully would be like "that". Avatar (2009) is the best movie I've ever seen overall. Neither of stories, pictures, and characters. Very amazing.

(I do not think what I write here can be counted as a spoiler, but I ticked the box just in case). The Matrix Revolutions is a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy, ending the perfect birth, life, death cycle that the whole story seems to explain. I found that this movie didn't grip me as much as the first two, the same as the second one didn't quite level up with the first. The thing is that not much happens in it, if you cut out the thousands of fight scenes then you'd be left with about half an hours worth of movie. I admit that I like battle scenes, I normally enjoy them a lot, but they were just too long and a little repetitive. The philosophical dialog in the first two movies has been replaced with guns and death, I was at least expecting Smith to do one of the usual 'psyche up fight talks' before the end, but not much was said, apart from 'I'm going to kill you' - something which is incredibly cliche in the good vs. evil world. I think that the main problem with The Matrix Revolutions is that the first too films asked questions that the final one couldn't answer. Simply because these questions are ones we have asked since the dawn of time and never been able to figure out. I like the idea that the point in life is death, it is interesting to look at, but apart from that there were no other deep points brought to light that had not already been thought of in the first two movies - and only one of them was actually mentioned. The final words were very apt for the movie, but I am still somewhat disappointed -- maybe that is just because I didn't want it to end. Part of me is still stuck in the fantasy world of the matrix, and I doubt I will ever escape it.

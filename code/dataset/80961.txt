Matrix Revolutions was better than Reloaded, but still disappointing: they just wrapped up the story, but there were no surprises. What's worse is that one of the expected surprises didn't materialize, leaving a key question unanswered. Still, it did actually advance the story, with some suspense and definitely great special effects, so I gave it a 7, just barely. With a better story, it could easily have been an 8 or 9 though...

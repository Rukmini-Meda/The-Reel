the script for episode 7 is done and 8 and 9 are in the works and this will help them come to fruition. He's already said he's not directing films anymore and it's cause of people like every hater, and complainer, and if people keep trashing him you'll never see them in your lifetime. 10/10. Lucas may not be the best director but fans ruined the prequels more than Lucas ever could. High expectations and whining when he tries to make them better. It's all worth it to see Yoda throw down. Anyone who says he ruined a classic (well, 3 classics) can do suckle on DC's NEW52 teat for a while. Drain that dry then come back to complaining about Saga. Anakin was supposed to be a whiny kid who lost everything b/c of his lust for power to stop what he ended up causing. Lucas created modern mythology and somehow it's not good enough. Go watch musicians act like actors and animated films and criticize cause that's all the haters are good for. Go Lucas. Bring them all back in 3D. I want to see episodes VII, VIII and IX, and possibly some Old Republic films. Honestly, if you read the comics from the 70's to the 90's and expected something different from the prequels you're just stupid.

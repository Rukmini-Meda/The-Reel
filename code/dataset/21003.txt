 Story and character development are basically non-existent, and events happen for no reason other than to move to the next incoherent action scene where the camera shakes all over the place. The original Clash of the Titans told pretty much the exact same story much better, and Harryhausen's effects have more character than the CGI seen here which feels just as fake but now happens in a computerised mess where it's hard to clearly see the monsters. The only saving graces are the often good cinematography and a host of good actors who turn in some decent work that's still well below their normal standards. Overall the whole film feels completely forgettable; a retelling of a better story which was already a mix of several Greek myths.

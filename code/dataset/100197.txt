 This movie is a gem screenplay, direction,music,acting in every department it scores 10 on 10.It inspired me in 2002 and even now when I watch it I cant help admiring both the movie and the person on whom it is based John Nash. The resilience with which he faced schizophrenia while publishing outstanding works time and again then going on to win the ultimate Nobel prize simply mesmerizes me.This movie apart from shahrukh khan inspired me to take Economics as a subject and I haven't regretted any moment after that.Instead of the mundaneness attached to mathematics by many he gives an artistic value to it simply admirable. I love the way he asks what are the other things people do in their lives while giving a questioning look to his friend a fellow mathematician. Each and every scene so beautifully merges to the next and keeps the viewer thoroughly engaged. When asked he sums up the difference between genius and excellence beautifully saying ''a lot''. great performances and the effect just stays on with you.

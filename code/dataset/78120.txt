Just the best movie of all time. Performances,dialogues,shots,camera work,sound, just everything is perfect about this movie. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone a.k.a "The Godfather" is a gem to this world of cinema. Both The Godfather 1 and The Godfather 2 are equally good in my opinion but cannot say the same about The Godfather 3.

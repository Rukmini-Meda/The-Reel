Saw it on TV recently. I thought that the interesting bit of the story starts at the end of the movie:

- The Africans tell them to bugger off because they have enough problems already.

- Half the people on board are military troops.

- Half the cargo is military stuff like weapons, ammo, tanks and probably even jets and missiles.

But that is probably too much reality to be depicted in a movie - at least in an American one. Perhaps some European guy is going to make the sequel? I would go into the cinema and pay to see that one. Luckily I didn't do that with this movie.

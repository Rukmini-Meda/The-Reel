2012 starts off with a bang with strange re-occurring events all over the world. The movie focuses on failed writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) trying to lead his family to nirvana in a world of disaster. When the global chaos finally arrives, a plethora of cheesy acting and deliberate stunts, failure hits this movie like puberty.

Chiwetel Ejiofor is the only reason you could consider giving this movie any sort of recognition. He portrays an average scientist who partially uncovers the expiration date for humanity. There is plenty of emotion that comes from the actors, but at some points in the film you are LAUGHING at how poor the scene is setup.

Johann Urb and Zlatko Buric are disgusting. It really makes you wonder how hard it would be to catch a role in a big picture. John Cusack loves to yell and curse but otherwise provides nothing to the film. The children are annoyances to what could've been some cool 'survival' esque parts of the film.

While plenty of money was spent for CGI, editing, and props, the film does not deliver in these categories. Some of the CGI is impressive but at certain times the green-screen backdrops are uncanny and appear unrealistic. Speaking of unrealism- they drive a car out of a plane's hangar!

Overall, 2012 was a failed conception of an apocalypse. You can see how bad it even was- it lost money in the initial box office as compared to budget. At some times you are bored, and other times you are laughing at how poorly scripted, acted, and edited this film is. The one thing that works okay is Chiwetel Ejiofor's actions of justice and some of the scenery.

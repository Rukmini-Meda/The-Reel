Upon first leaving the theater, i was disappointed in the final installment of the Matrix trilogy. As I started to read up on it, however, I realized it made perfect sense to end it the way they did. I don't like writing spoilers, so i'll avoid that. I'll just say don't judge it right away. Let the whole trilogy sink in and it will all make perfect sense. The fight scenes are just as good as ever, but the battle on Zion was a little long and sometimes repetitive. It did feature some great action, though. There are plenty of tense moments and some unforeseen events that will catch you off guard. Hugo Weaving does the best job and plays the coolest character in the entire trilogy in Agent Smith and his many, many clones. This movie is very good but the original Matrix is still my favorite. If you didn't like Reloaded, you probably won't like this one. I think it is a well made trilogy and one that should be seen, because as soon as you understand it, the Matrix has you. 7/10

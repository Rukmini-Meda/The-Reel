I guess my main problem with this movie is that it has tinkered to much with the real John Nash, his life, and illness. Probably if the movie had been a documentary it would have been to boring, but great liberties are taken around his personal life etc to cast doubts over its overall integrity.

That said, it is a movie that forces the viewer to engage, and even might demand that critical viewers reflect on their own mental issues. As a recovered (hopefully) alcoholic I never underestimate the power and nature of the deranged mind.

It was an interesting choice for Russell Crowe to play the part of Nash, and certainly the support crew is superb. Crowe does a good job but coming so close after Gladiator I do wonder if there might have been another choice.

At a personal level I find this challenging and while I watch it about once a year sometimes I need to turn it off. Not perfect, but challenging, and pleased to see it hanging in to the IMDb Top 250 list.

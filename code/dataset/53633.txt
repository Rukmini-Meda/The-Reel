While Avatar maybe doesn't deserve to be the film with biggest box-office record, it's not so much of a 'bad story, eye candy' film as it is made believed in other reviews. Avatar was truly a breakthrough in filmmaking almost comparable to what Star Wars did in 1977, from the visual effects aspect of filmmaking. The motion-capture technology and advanced rendering sistem was nearly invented with this film, and is now commonly used in many films. And this movie is one of the few ones that has no CGI flaw in nearly 3 hours almost entirely shot in CGI, which is quite outstanding. We're introduced to a visually appealing world, really wonderful and also realistic (thanks to the mentioned advanced visuals). The opposite military-sci-fi technology of men makes the whole film unique. Story wise, it almost seems a natives vs white explorers story, just with aliens versus humans, and some misticism of different sorts. The existence of the dragon-like creatures makes the whole thing get a fantasy touch too. Plus we have some good old sci-fi, with the concept of Avatars. Really, this movie has a quite unique merging of different concepts. Casting worked perfectly to me, and so did direction. The ambientalist/freedom message is though kinda obvious, but it's also not as important as it might seem in order to enjoy the film. I really enjoyed the depiction of battles as well. Overall, an at least once must see film.

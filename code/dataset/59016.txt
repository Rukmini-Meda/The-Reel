2012 is definitely one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. No movie has ever taken the "Apocalypse theme" to the heights that 2012 did. Directed by Ronald Emmerich, the talented director behind The Day After Tomorrow and 10000 BC, this movie pushes the limits of modern CGI effects and action scenes. The pacing of the movie is great and never leaves the viewer with a moment of boredom. Along with the great action scenes, the movie also makes a great message of worldwide unity between peoples rather than money and politics. 2012 is no doubt Ronald Emmerich's biggest movie.

If you enjoy idiotic cartoons and you are under 15 years old you might love this incredibly silly movie. How Avatar is rated better than other wonderful movies makes me question the ability of the moronic raters! I do not hate Avatar but I would not rate it higher than 4.5 out of 10. Numerous Philip K. Dick legendary movies are not rated as well ads Avatar (which is very foolish!)! I think Avatar might be a childish SciFi genera, and is not bad for teens or tweens (my children loved it)! But they like lots of Harry Potterish stuff:-) :-) So if you are a Science Fiction fan and have a College degree you will not finish watching Avatar!!! I rated it 1 but as I said it may be rated as well as 4.5 if you are under 17 years old.

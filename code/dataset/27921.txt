No doubt that the adaptation from its beloved Broadway musical and the book is considered a great musical that has the heart, soul and the spirit of humanity to see and believe it.

Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway is indeed worth seeing as they delivered their great performances well of course both of them stand out as the highlight of the movie.

Even some of the members of the cast done a good performances most notably Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen did manage to deliver subtly yet good performances even though they look bland and cartoonish.

But the same applause can't be said to Russell Crowe. My goodness, where to begin with? Although, Crowe's acting is good but singing is completely not good and completely this flaw could have ruined this movie if not saved by the performances of Jackman and Hathaway. I would described Crowe's worst fiasco in singing is similar to Pierce Brosnan's wounded raccoon singing performance in Mamma Mia.

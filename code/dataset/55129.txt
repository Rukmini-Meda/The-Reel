The worst part about this movie is the acting. I know that the CGI and Pandora are supposed to be so amazing that you fail to recognize that during any emotional scene, they increase the sound of the music so you don't recognize the awful acting. Part of that terrible acting is the script. It's so stupid that one would have to be mesmerized by the special effects to not notice it. Let's look at it this way. You have the Ore that floats in the D-bag's office. If the ore floats on it's own, why would the company waste its time drilling when it could just take a floating mountain away? If it wasn't floating because it has no floating properties, why would you not just start with the floating mountains. Seriously, if these masses of rock are just floating in the sky, that would be extremely beneficial for things like flying or movie heavy objects with less friction. There is no reason why the army and company would ignore this area.

Second, why do we give a crap about the blue natives? Its the whole "noble savage" malarkey with a pantheism new age connectivity aspect. Sorry, but if I wanted to laugh at earth worship, I'd just watch a five minute clip of hippies protesting oil rigs from a boat that needs tons of fuel just to get them out to protest. Pantheism is the new environmentalism and this movie is nothing but a promotion of world worship.

So, the CGI looks nice, but if you want substance, this movie is seriously lacking. People say that this movie has soul, but that's totally stupid. It has the same story as Dances with wolves with the acting of a fourth grade play. Don't waste your time on this movie. It's crap acting in a crap story painted in crap blue and put in a 3d theater. We're too busy looking at the CGI to recognize that this movie is a typhoon of crap, a crap-phoon, of such epic size that it would be rejected as the ending of the Abyss (see what I did there?). James Cameron, I like what you've done in the past, but this movie is awful.

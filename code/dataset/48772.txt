"Timeo danaos, et dona ferentes," as Julius Caesar himself said. Perseus is the legendary founding father of the Mycean Danaans, but in this film, beware of what he bears: a lackluster performance in a lackluster remake.

The plot substitutes Hades for Poseidon as the wrathful God, and Perseus' female chaperone Io for princess Andromeda. The main purpose of the latter seems to be to allow a female character to tag along for the quest; maybe not necessary when you are making a teen-boy action film.

The strangest thing about this movie is the mash-up of special effect elements from other fantasy films, rather than coming up with its own elements. For instance, we have Ray Harryhausen's scorpions blown to gigantic size, so like the oliphaunts in "The Lord of the Rings" they can bear tents on their backs guided by desert people.

The script writing is weak (Perseus curses "like hell" a lot, instead of "like Hades"; his motive is base revenge instead of noble love and salvation; etc) and derivative (of the original and LOTR of all things!), the characters are pretty anemic, with the Gods more human than the humans.

A mediocre film than can be watched once, not bad enough to get upset about, not good enough to displace any of the memes created by Harryhausen for the Perseus myth.

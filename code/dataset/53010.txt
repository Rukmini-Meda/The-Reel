Episode one isn't the worst in the series but it is a bad movie. The best part about the film was Darth Maul which was fantastic and went on to be the best character in Star wars but he is barley used like why he is brilliant and way more cooler then Vader. The acting sucks mainly from Jake Lloyd who sucks and is probably the worst child actor of all time and the movie is extremely boring and the plot is really confusing and I still don't get it to this day. This film does expose the fact George Lucas isn't a good director and I still don't know where the idea of Star wars came from but Lucas ruined Star wars no question about it.

I will try to do this to the best of my ability so the film starts with a ship being invaded by Obi Wan and Qui-Gon Jinn for some reason then they go get queen amidala. Then there ship gets messed up and they arrive at the home planet of soon to be Luke Sky walker and find his farther Anakin who is a slave then wins a race then is free and goes with Qui-Gon after finding out what he is capable of. He is then trained and Darth Maul is trying to find Anakin because Darth sidious wants him.

The movie is bad and confusing but if your a fan like me then watch it I guess because it's not as bad as I thought it would be but it still sucks.

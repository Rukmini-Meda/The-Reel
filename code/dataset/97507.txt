Very lame. I guess the story behind the movie goes something like this: Sylvester Stallone decides to make a movie with old buddies, most of whom are, like him, has-beens who never could act anyway (see Dolph Lundgren, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eric Roberts, Jet Li), though some (Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis) are pretty good. Decides to throw in some fresh, well-known faces (Jason Statham, David Zayas of Dexter fame) and sports stars (Randy Couture, Steve Austin) to bring in the kids. Having locked in the cast, discovers there is no budget left for a decent writer or director, so decides to do those himself.

Thus was born The Expendables - no plot, no direction, but every face a star and heaps of crap gets blown up in bright colours and with a loud bang.

Avoid, unless you want to be able to pinpoint the moment your IQ reduced.

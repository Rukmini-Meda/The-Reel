This movie is hilariously stupid! It's laugh out loud so over the top with its disasters happening and so quickly too and it takes way too long to get its message across. The only stars who hold the movie are John Cusack, Woodly Harrelson and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Thandie Newton tries her best with the female lead but isn't up to much. Oliver Platt boy do I want to punch him in his great big teeth or wish it was written in the script for one of the characters to do so. I know it's his character Carl that grates but do you not want to hit him in the whole movie with the heartlessness and just overall cruelty??

Awful movie - don't bother wasting your time. Gets me down totally. No happiness to it really

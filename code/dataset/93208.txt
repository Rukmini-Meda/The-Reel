This is a great movie with a good story, awesome graphics, and a good cast. It leaves you wanting more, which is always a sign of a good movie.

Sam Worthington (my Jake) has become a part of my list of actors to watch, and even though Zoe Saldana did not make an actual appearance, she can convey everything masterfully with just her voice, she too is a name I watch for.

Aside from the beautiful colors and scenery, this movie displays something that I have never seen before, even after all the previews I was still pleasantly surprised.

I am anxiously awaiting more!

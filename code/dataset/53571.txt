The human city of Zion defends itself against the massive invasion of the machines as Neo fights to end the war at another front while also opposing the rogue Agent Smith. The Matrix Revolutions is by no means better than the first or second film i mean the first act is kinda slow but 2nd and especially the 3rd act are very good. The Mr. Smith vs Neo battle was very good sure it had some dumb cgi moments in it but overall a great enjoyable battle that pretty much is the highlight of the movie also the fact that Neo gets taken or probably he is dead nobody will ever know and Trinity died as well but the movie ends in a Happy way doesn't mean that it's a bad sequel i mean just look Terminator 2 for example Arnold dies and the world gets saved i don't compare a good sequel to one of the best movies ever made i'm just saying that every film sometimes deserves a good ending instead of a mass destruction one. Also don't try to compare this to Matrix or even Reloaded all this 3 movies are different on their own way and honestly i think this is the last good film the The Wachowski Brothers ever made but also if you play the game "Path of Neo" you will see that the ending is way different and longer than the one that the film has 8/10.

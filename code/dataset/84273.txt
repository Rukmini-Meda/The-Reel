After seeing this film multiple times, it took me years to buckle down and read the book. It was is I was reading a different story. The film "A Beautiful Mind" starring Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris was a gripping real life story of Nobel Prize awarded mathematician John Nash and his out of the box way of solving problems and learning the greatest lesson of life. Director Ron Howard did an excellent job of selecting the right team to bring the story from book to screen in a way that would keep viewers inspired, intrigued and with the ending wanting to learn more about the real life of John Nash. Watching this film one time is not enough as there are many scenes and sequences packed with the building blocks that tell viewers how John Nash played by Russell Crowe how he went from an being normal to discovering his unique abilities. What's also inspiring John Nash's wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and her undying dedication and loyalty through John's severe struggle of separating the real world from fantasy. William Parcher played by Ed Harris is a fooler in this film as we think he's one thing, but turns out to be another. "A Beautiful Mind" is one of those films that you will never get bored of watching as it's not only inspiring, but you may catch a detail that you didn't pick up the last time around. As mentioned before, watching the film and referencing the book was shocking as so many details were left out that it seemed I was reading a different story and John Nash was more complex than the movie portrayed, in which the film character was a very complicated person. What both the book and the film did accomplish in sync was telling a story of a genius who wanted to discover the complex answers and found the simple solution. A definite must own movie.

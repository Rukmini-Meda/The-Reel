I did like The Matrix Revolutions but it just might have a little too much action. I indeed say that the action was impressive but the 2nd and this one does not have much realistic 3-D as the 1st one. Again there was not much of a story either. If this had a story like the 1st one, it would've been probably as successful. When the sentinels were attacking Zion was a cool scene and when Neo was fighting Agent Smith for the last time it was indeed cool too. I did enjoy it though but I honestly think this could've been a lot better and I shouldn't of been that anticipated in excitement of seeing this.

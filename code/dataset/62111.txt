"Amadeus" is one of the great films of all time. It is a fictionalization of the later years of Mozart's life, though it does contain many actual happenings from his life.

Mozart (Tom Hulce) is a musical genius who possesses some juvenile qualities. He is impetuous, immature, naive, given to fanciful behavior. At the same time, he is a gifted musician and a driven composer. His marries a young woman named Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), who proves to be dedicated to her husband.

Wolfgang lives in the shadow of his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice), who groomed him from an early age for musical success, escorting him throughout Europe where he performed for crowned heads and ecclesiastics. Mozart's devotion and desire for the approval of his father never waivers, even after Leopold's death.

The story of the film is told--primarily in flashback--by Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), another composer in Vienna, a man who both worshipped and despised Mozart. This duality of feeling is the focus of the film. Salieri--more than anyone else--recognizes the genius of Mozart's work, but finds Mozart the man to be a repudiation from God, to whom he had dedicated his life. Mozart's vulgarity offends Salieri, causing him to vow enmity toward God.

Everything about this film is superior: the music (naturally), the cinematography, the acting, the writing, the costuming, the makeup, the lighting, etc. The performance of Tom Hulce is brave. Jeffrey Jones, who plays Emperor Joseph II, shows why he may be the most underrated actor in Hollywood. F. Murray Abraham's performance is inspired.

In at least three scenes, Abraham as Salieri describes Mozart's music with an adoration that is palpable, blessing the viewer with a rarefied experience. Through him, we experience the bliss that Mozart's genius permits. Mozart and Salieri have a complex relationship that "Amadeus" explores beautifully. It certainly deserved the Oscar for Best Film.

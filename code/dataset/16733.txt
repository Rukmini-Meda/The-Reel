I just finished watching the extended collector's edition of Avatar and, God, this movie is really one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life.

The viewer is befuddled by so many incredible emotions while experiencing all that the Na'vi people can show us.

We absorb varied Lessions, about altruism and sensibility with other species and people, teaching us to not only look inside ourselves but to look for our brothers in order to comprehend and respect them for what they are and all that they carry inside; willpower and love, inviting us to search for the meaning of life, fight for the good causes and for what we really believe, even if that demand us our own life for that, like Paul teaches in the Holy Bible, especially in his letters to the Corinthians.

Anyway, I could spend an entire day describing the grandeur spread throughout this piece of art. I sincerely encourage anyone to what Avatar with naked eyes and clean their thoughts in order to take full advantage of this unique experience.

I hope that movie industry will be capable of making more movies like this one, exploring the best in our perceptions and feelings, rather than appealing to lower things which humanity carries, like meaningless sexuality, abusive violence, envy et cetera, trying to make the world understand those things like the ones that define humans themselves.

Honestly, I prefer believing in our capacity to reborn as awesome Avatars, I mean, people, ready to make a real difference in the world we live.

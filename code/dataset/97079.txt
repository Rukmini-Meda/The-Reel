A beautiful mind is a movie that shows amazing screenplay with breath taking audio support. I want to start by talking about the music that supports certain scene, the music is by James Horner and after watching the movie multiple times i still listen daily to the soundtracks. Their are multiple songs that stand out that can make my picture the settings of the movie. One of my personal favorite is 'A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics' and 'Creating "Governing Dynamics"'.

The movie in mainly dominated by its amazing actors that deliver a meaningfully message, but besides its actors it delivers a solid job on the direction. My personal opinion about the cast for certain actors is debatable, for example Paul Bethany as Charles. However i automatically fell in love with Jennifer Connelly that delivers a stunning performance as Alicia Nash.

The story line is deep and meaningful keeping viewers attention until the credits roll. It makes good use of the effects of surprise and bonding. Even after many times watching the movie i see each actor as a new friend. This makes it extremely enjoyable to watch over and over again.

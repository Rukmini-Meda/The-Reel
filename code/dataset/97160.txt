What is all the fuss about? Seriously... OK, yes the acting is really excellent and the graphics are insanely amazing but other than that I cannot see why so many people love this film.

I believe that the plot line is wafer thin, the film is poorly scripted and is poorly directed for most of it. Therefore, despite the millions and millions of dollars spent on the production, the team that worked on this movie still came out with a mediocre film that looked as if it was made by amateurs that have the ability, equipment and money to produce incredible graphics.

I think that the only reason this movie has such a huge reputation is because of these graphics and if they were normal no one would enjoy this movie as much as they do. So if you are one of the few people that still have not seen this film, then watch it to make up your own mind but I wouldn't recommend it.

 Look i'm an 80's geek i love Stallone & Schwarzenegger so when i saw the trailer and the photos for this movie i just had to see it right now. There's something that always bugged me with this series that people don't get the Expendables are not meant to be taken seriously it's meant to have comic relief and one liners and old people kicking the crap out of younger people it's the same people we all grew up just older and also some new ones like Jason Statham. The team is great you have Sly who nails it every time, Christmas played by Statham who is badass (Basketball scene hell yeah) and also Dolph Lundgren who fights Jet Li and it's pure badass and Steve Austin who should be the main villain because Eric Roberts? totally miscasted here i don't hate him i own and love Best of the Best but going tall to tall with Sylvester Stallone? Yeah No. Other than that EX1 is still a great movie with it's problems and it's highlights. I was going to give the film a 9 but it has a lot of good stuff in it and a really cool bloody opening so yeah 10 out of 10.

"The Matrix Revolutions" suffers from the same problems that plague "Reloaded", although this time there's an unshakably depressing tone. The movie has a sort-of hopeful ending, but it's still a major downer, and the core three characters deserved better. And a sizable chunk of the movie's running time is spent on the garish Zion scenes (sure, that's where the film's humanity is, but I kept wanting to return to the admittedly more striking world of the Matrix).

But the movie's preoccupied with the idea of Neo and Smith as two variables in a larger equation. And the weird thing is that, for that larger theme and for all of the fight moves and bullets fired, everything comes down to an underwhelming Superman fistfight.

It shouldn't be this boring. That's the most disappointing thing about all of this.

3/10

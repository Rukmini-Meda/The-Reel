I get why people like/love this movie. It really is a symphony of 'blood bath'. The third act bombardment is like action diarrhea. Way too long. I think it might of been a better movie if I was a guy and if there was a bit more story. Chick flick this ain't.

So lets just say: Not my thing...

However, I must concede it was a stellar sound tract.

I would guess that HALF the budget for this movie was spent on the killer songs. Every ballad was perfect in tone and valor for each scene.

In fact, I'd watch it again to hear the music.

Jeff Kimball cinematographer... kudos man... you make all things look grand.

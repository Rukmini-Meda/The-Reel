A Beautiful Mind is consistently engrossing as an unusual character study and as a trip to the mysterious border-crossing between rarified brilliance and madness. It's a Hollywood biopic of maths genius John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe), whose brilliant career was blighted by schizophrenia and paranoid delusions.

The film ascribes a great deal less intelligence to its audience than it does to its subject, approaching his life through a prism of dubious narrative gimmickry and with much overrated acting. A feeling of Oscar-grab mendacity is hard to shake off. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life.

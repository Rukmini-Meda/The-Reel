First off, I found that the attempt at humor at this time of destruction was unnecessary and weak. Mr Roland does this quite a bit in his movies when there is total havoc occurring and then 'tries' to break the tension with an attempt at humor. I honestly think this approach has made some of his movies seem silly. I mean, isn't that what we see these movies for? The tension? (Case in point also "Godzilla" and "ID4"). All these movies had great potential for the human element but instead focused on effects rather than the human scale of tragedy. These were not funny situations so why try to be funny? It fails in my opinion. Don't make a serious situation then lace it with laughs. Now if your are like a lot of viewers today and could care less about any believability, then this is the movie for you! If all you crave is explosions, earthquakes, tidal waves and the like then you wont care if the characters are/act stupid. But there are some of us out there who like the action but ALSO like some realistic approaches when it comes to people, not stereotypes & silly accents. Yes, this movie is about the end of the world, billions upon billions of deaths, disaster all around and it should be treated in a darker manner instead of like watching an afternoon matinee of Dagwood Bumstead. Its very hard to sympathize with any character since the script seemed to fail in every direction. I mean, why spend 200 million just to have people laugh and be uncaring? Effects, effects, effects is the answer. It seems all people want anymore is just a bunch of explosions on the silver screen. Some of us crave a bit more than visual stimulation. Now, like I stated that if its just "Bing Bam Boom" is all you want, then this is the flick but if you want a bit more of a human story then I would steer clear. I honestly believe giving this a 5 star rating is being overly generous. I leave it up to the viewer to decide.

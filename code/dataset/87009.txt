I thought the first matrix film was a classic, (if still somewhat confusing) but the second was alright, because i thought all the answers to the film's concept would be answered in the third installment. I was wrong...

Instead of taking us into the heart of the matrix, we get some giant war film with fantastic special effects and fight scenes with millions of agent smiths up against Neo. Yeah, we saw that all in the second film...

I don't know if those huge die-hard Matrix fans will still be talking about these films after this third installment is shown...to be missed.

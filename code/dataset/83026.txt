My history with this marvelous film covers a broad spectrum. Opening weekend, in our excitement we took the last seats available in a giant IMAX theater near Washington D.C. It was my fault that we set in the second row and I got motion sickness from the 3-D. (Literally had to go out for fresh air a couple times.) So, although I admired the look and risks of the filmmakers... I missed seeing several sections and the plot lost me. Again my fault.

So a year goes by and we are returning from England on a jumbo jet that offers Avatar as in in-flight movie (ha! what waste you say) and I say, yes but. If I don't get a film (as in this case) I may need to revisit and watching a 7" screen forces one to listen to the dialogue, understand the characters motivation and delve deep into the story -- if it's there.

I was rewarded with a wonderful story of redemption, healing, respect, greed, love, compassion, fear, force and surrender. Bottom line I too recommend it's ideals of respecting nature and natives all the while selling popcorn, tickets and DVD units.

Today, I'm watching my BluRay on my 4k giant screen TV and it hits me... a soldier sent to a remote outpost meets and bonds with the locals. And even though he is an immigrant (another word for stranger), the locals are patient and forgiving eventually welcoming the new person as a friend, even family... then someone with more money/power/resources FORCES their will on the smaller, weaker claiming it is for their own good that they are being robbed, stolen from and killed... just like in Dances With Wolves. (another fine film.) Thanks for reading, larry41onebay.

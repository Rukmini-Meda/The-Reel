This movie is possibly one of the most poorly written screenplays out there. The characters can't be related to, the supporting characters aren't explained and die very quickly, the whole movie feels rushed and incoherent, the action is cliche and predicable, the climax is 2d and involves no engaging plot twist, and the ending is just as silly as the rest of the film. I think the people who wrote this film should find a new job. Also, the acting was very poor. The actors look like they are standing in front of a greenscreen and saying their lines in a "cool" accent. The costuming is either plasticy or obviously CGI. While this type of movie may be amusing to ten year old boys, it does not stack up against other movies of the genre.

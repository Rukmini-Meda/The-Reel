Clash of the Titans was for me the best action, adventure fantasy of 2010. Fantastic CGI, especially on Medusa and The Kraken and a well written storyline made this film one of my favourite reboots. The action scenes were epic and very enjoyable to watch. The acting was inconsistent however, Sam Worthington doesn't have a great range for an actor and as i had seen other films with him in in the same year i found him quite monotonous. However, Ralph Fiennes was a superb Hades and as a character who should be feared, he did not disappoint. Among the other actors, Liam Neeson and Jason Fleming were also impressive in their roles. It is a typical action blockbuster that is very enjoyable to watch.

 A good movie..rather, one of my favorites. I'm not an action flick kind of person but I do enjoy an adrenaline laced lifestyle when affordable. I think the critics are highly biased and just plain negative when it comes to reviews (they expect high dollar, blockbuster masterpieces and nothing short of that). Many people are too, when the subject of Stallone's acting or directing rise. He's an actor, so to expect award winning directorial work is naive. A damn good one. Even in this film, he still maintains his rep, though watered down a bit. An action film with fans that hope for romance and comedy? Although the film supplies little of both (its action so what do you expect?), it provides enough to develop the characters for the storyline. To learn how to shape expectations may never be mastered. But to realize a good film given the efforts of actors and directors both despite its shortcomings is something we should be familiar with, especially since many classic films cannot be matched, merely "redone." I liked this movie quite a bit and was intrigued by negative reviews and so decided to put my two cents in. Thanks for reading.

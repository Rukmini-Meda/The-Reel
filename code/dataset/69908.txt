This guy, Nash, going to an ivy league school should have been able to research possible causes of psychosis/delirium. Could he not suspect heavy metals such as lead, with his extensive training? The doctors refuse to detox patients? How hard is it for people to understand lead poisoning and the dangers of heavy metals? The doctors could have used heavy metal chelation. They could do it for the navy in the 1960's but for regular people no? Mr Nash should have had proper treatment, instead of them leaving him sick and calling it an awful illness. Then, glamorizing it as a Hollywood spectacle. Come on help these poor people.

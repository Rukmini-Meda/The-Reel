 So, CGI effects depict the worlds' end spreading from L.A. to DC and eventually over the tallest mountains on earth only to leave Africa untouched? Every country agrees to do the humanitarian thing only to show the American authority caving to a moral majority which is not theirs? A plastic surgeon and a Russian millionaire die while a government underling and barely employed writer save the world? ...And how did the the smart scientists not know that Africa wasn't being touched while the Himalyas disappeared under water? Wow! The writer throws away all logic and probabilty while making a really fun disaster movie full of death defying action (well, death defying for some). All of that end of days drama to end with the revelation that the 7 year old daughter doesn't need to wear Pull Ups anymore? John Cusak is his usual likable hero, Oliver Platt is the authority bad guy who makes more sense than you'd like to admit and Chiwetel Ejopjer plays to government scientist do-gooder who is always where he can make a difference despite the logic that says his discoveries would have been made by about 30-40 scientists, doctors and politicians over time. A movie for the eyes, but not much for the brain....

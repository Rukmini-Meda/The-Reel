I remember when this movie came out how all the kids were lined up to see it before the world ended. Kids, nothing will stop Hollywood from making B-grade movies while you will pay for them, and that is what you have in 2012.

The world is going to end, but fortunately, John Cusack knows how to save the day as a chauffeur for this rick Russian businessman. The special effects are everywhere as suddenly the world is exploding and these guys stay one step ahead.

Put your reality hat in the closet for this one guys, which is pretty much what you should have expected going in. At the end of the day, if you want a movie with no real plot, stupid banter, sub-par acting, and good CGI, well, you have come to the right place. I watched this twice now, so I guess it's not terrible, but rather, an mindless way to spend 2 hours of your time without engaging your brain much.

Enjoy.

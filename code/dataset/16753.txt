 With a hundred million f*cking dollars why is it hard to make a good movie? How is that difficult? It took more effort to make this movie a total piece of sh*t than had they made the movie good. Point by point from this movie's conception to the final stage of it's being, it's just bad ideas strung together. Who knew you could consistently link up bad ideas and have anything come of it? Usually a series of bad ideas ends in nullification or death, but not 2012, somehow it goes on. That is impressive. Zero plot multiplied by zero dialog divided by zero acting equals what? How many women were manipulated and deceived just so the producers of this movie could have sex with them? 2012?

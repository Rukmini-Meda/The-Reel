The Expendables is one of the movies Sylvester Stallone has been making since the 1980's. In this sense, The Expendables could be classified as "what you see is what you get". There are endless amounts of testosterone, shooting, explosions and other action sequences.

And after all has quieted down, Sylvester Stallone would sit in the cockpit of his airplane and sip on a beer while flying his team to a safe haven. There are also some jokes along the way, as a regular staple in such movies.

Otherwise there is not much to be said or remembered about The Expendables.

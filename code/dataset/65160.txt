There is a times in every amazing movie when you can't turn your head and your consideration is at its maximum, well, this movie will stick your head to the screen at every single minute of it!!!

It has Amazing Story, Amazing Act, Amazing Songs and Amazing Direction! Its just perfect in every aspect. There are few movies that manage to contain all of these factors.

In top of that, It has one of the best romantic stories with complex inter-relationships. In addition, the fight between evil and good is not traditional and direct like other movies. Personalities of the actors are time-events changing as well.

The only thing I did not like is one sentence in the opening song that says "no God Above". I think its racist and tries to promote wrong ideas.

Other than that, Just go watch it right now!!!

In this episode, we can see both the growth and the root of dark side of Anakin. He takes part with his mother to training under Kwai Gan Jin. Through the adventure with Jedies, he grows, but the parting with his mother and the encounter of Padme become the root of his dark side. And it becomes his weakness. Also, Obi Wan is supposed to grow because of the death of his master. He cannot relies on master, ant the time comes when he has to becomes independent.By the way, this movie (Star Wars series) always brings unique villains. Their appearances, the ways of fighting, and characters are differ from each one. I think this is because not only attract audience, but also make the hardships for Jedies. This time, the villain's appearance is scary and his fighting strength is also powerful. I watched this movie when I was a child, but I like it so I watch it still now.

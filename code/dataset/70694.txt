Episode 1 has been cited as one of the biggest disappointments in cinema. Or maybe because people expected too much out of it? I don't know, all I'm saying is that this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time behind Jaws. The story is more mature than all of the Star Wars films, it's about how the Trade Federation wants the Chancellor to sign a treaty to trade routes of the Galactic Republic, but she refuses, and so there is huge chaos around the decision. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi plan to train a young Anakin Skywalker. This film is truly wonderful to gaze upon, with underwater cities and dogfights that include a huge amount of imagination. Darth Maul is a more than worthy villain that has lightsaber dueling skills that are undeniably awesome. The characters add enough humor and charm to make the film more lighthearted, particularly the aliens in Naboo and Jar-Jar Binks(whom is a lovable character in my eyes). Overall, TPM is the best of the Star Wars saga and the best sci-fi movie ever made with a more adult plot than most of them, phenomenal visuals, an epic villain, and well-realized and memorable characters.

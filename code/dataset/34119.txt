Tom Hulce as Mozart basically ruins the film with his relentless mugging; he was only chosen because of his cackling laugh.

The movie has lavish set designs and costumes, but the underlying hatred of Italians makes the film mean-spirited. In fact, ask yourself why the film-makers wanted to disrespect the Italians so vehemently. Other mistakes include the casting of Lez Berridge, who annoyingly refers to 'Wolfgang Mozart' as "Volfie", her Brooklyn accent in tow-- make that her Coney Island accent.

Worth tuning in to see a perfect performance by Murry Abrahum playing the Italian musical genius, Antonio Salieri.

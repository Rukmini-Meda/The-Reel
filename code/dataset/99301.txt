 If you liked "Independence Day" and disaster movies, you will love this movie. This had me sitting on the edge of my seat for half of the movie, and I think I found my 82 year old mother huddling under the chair. It's full of action, disasters, and I don't think appropriate for young audiences, because a lot would have to be explained to them. But if this is what the earth will become when the end of the world comes, I don't want to be here. Watch it, it's a good movie!! One of the best disaster movies I've seen in a long time. Maybe the Aztec's had something to their dates when they said 12/21/12...wow, does that mean we don't have to prepare for Christmas next year?!?! LOL

I saw this movie 5 times and I loved it every time. What if it's a historical fiction? Without this movie, Salieri's works would be unknown today to the general public.

The film itself has everything: funny moments, emotional moments, great script, the costumes and settings are a delight to the eye, the acting is perfect. Yes, perfect, and that goes even for the smallest roles. First of all, F.M. Abraham's interpretation is a masterpiece. He plays both Salieri as an adult and as an old man. And he does an exquisite job with both of them. Tom Hulce is a great W.A. Mozart: flamboyant, funny, pantagruelesque, playful and solemn at the same time. All the actors did the best with their parts. I remember the scene where Mozart's maid cries before Salieri...just look at her facial expression. The horror is so real! Or when Salieri reads Mozart's manuscripts: that is the look of a transcended man; Salieri looks like he just had an orgasm. This movie has a lot of strong points, but the acting is the best of them. I have mentioned just a few, but Orsini-Rosenberg, capellmeister Bonno, Emanuel Schikaneder, Katerina Cavalieri were all played masterfully.

This movie is a titan of it's genre. 10 out of 10.

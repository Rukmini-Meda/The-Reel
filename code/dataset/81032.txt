 I have loved this film ever since I was a child. Great sound track,and awesome story. I especially like to watch this film when its a total Veg kinda day. Totally great experience when you smoke a little sticky icky, and want a good story told with great music to boot. If you don't like classical, I think this movie is still entertaining. I like classical, so its win win for me. :) The acting was great, as well as the characters. Loved costumes. If you get the chance view the directors cut. The movie is a bit longer, but worth it. You do not get good story lines followed with real talented actors anymore. Now you get unoriginal , remade crap, with So n So's brother, daughter, son...blah blah as headliners in the movies. Just because you father or mother was a famous actor does not give these people merit as to being talented themselves...ugh...Hollywood Monarchy. I probably sound angry and bitter, I am. So what? Back to the subject at hand. Amadeus, good film , sober or stoned. Give it a try.

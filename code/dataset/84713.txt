 The Expendables (2010): Dir: Sylvester Stallone / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke: Mindless action garbage about those whom elevate others beyond themselves. Sylvester Stallone leads a band of bad-asses to a war torn country where they blow up everything in sight. The characters are given very little background as it becomes very clear that Stallone's ambition is not in story but in casting every famous action star within reach. It is like a lineup of near retired action stars along with a few newer faces to the genre and nobody gives a sh*t about the whole charade. As director Stallone is more interested in showing off various angles to through a knife or shoot someone. It is one thing for Stallone to round up all of these famous names but why not write them into a story worth telling. This is all bang bang pow and whatever other word they use to describe action. Besides Stallone there is a slew of ass kickers including Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others and they are all given their big chaotic action scene. Stallone plays the desperate hero who goes back into massive danger over a woman. Jet Li gets his ass kicked by Lundgren but we are given that witless conclusion where all is forgiven and Lundgren stands with that stupid grin on his face even though he tried to wrap Li's body around several solid objects. Mickey Rourke was wonderful in The Wrestler, but here he is just along for the ride with his fellow action buddies. This film is expendable in more ways than one and should be backed over by a truck. Score: 2 / 10

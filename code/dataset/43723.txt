 Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Mads Mikkelsen, Alexa Davalos and Gemma Arterton star in this 2010 fantasy remake of the 1981 classic. Worthington (Avatar) plays young man, Perseus who loses his adopted family to evil God, Hades (Fiennes). Soon, he meets Io, a mysterious woman who helps and tells him he's the son of God, Zeus (Neeson). Perseus is chosen to go on a quest to save the kingdom of Argos and Princess, Andromeda (Davalos) by battling mythic beasts and facing Hades. Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) plays Draco, Captain of the King's guard who helps Perseus. Though the original is superior, this isn't a bad remake featuring a good cast, great score & neat effects. My only gripe is Worthington's shaved head look because they didn't have barbers in those times. I still recommend this.

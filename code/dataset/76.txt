what did you expect? too much, I suspect. considering the can of worms it opened itself in the first movie, I'd say the loose ends were gathered together quite well by revolutions. let's see all you people try to come up with a good, satisfying conclusion! there is still a lot of interesting stuff to read into in revolutions, and you don't even need to read too deeply to find a satisfactory solution to the trilogy. okay, so it wasn't the greatest...but it wasn't that bad, either. despite the decline as it went on, the series as a whole is still 9/10 in my eyes, for all the neat ideas it brought up and explored.

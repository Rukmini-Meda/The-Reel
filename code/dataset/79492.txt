This is a wonderful film in many ways. The mental struggle Russel Crowe's character endures is heartbreaking. What a powerful mind, too much so even for life, relationships, and happiness.

There are a few twists. Most folks will be able to predict one or even all, but, nevertheless, you are along for the ride with Crowe's character. Even if you are not as surprised by certain story breakthroughs as some will be, the connection you feel to John Nash is undeniable. You want to see him succeed and you want him to just get better.

Either way, I consider this film melodrama, with some truly outrageous occurrences that push it into the realm of silly, but, not enough to ruin the overall impact of the film.

This film requires your attention for full immersion into the story, but, you will not be disappointed if you put in the effort.

I've never seen any other production of this title, so I was in for the experience at 100%. The story line was fantastic! I disagreed with the goof that Marius didn't know Eponine's father at the wedding because he DID know who she was and earlier in the show, he says, "find her and don't tell your father." Russell Crow's voice was amazing!! Not one time did I have to play-back his scenes with the subtitles to know what he was saying. He articulates wonderfully!! Anne made me cry, Hugh made me cry... the emotion was definitely there.

Thank you film makers for the experience of a life-time. I'll watch it again and probably learn the songs. ;)

If your looking for 3 hour Oscar winning drama. Then Don't see this movie. But If your your looking for a bunch of big bad asses blow stuff up. Then this movie will not disappoint. First of all if you go into this movie excepting a good storyline with a full plot then your horribly mistaken. Just look at the cast. This movie has almost nothing but gun fights,fist fights and explosions. But who ever said that was a bad thing.

As far as acting goes its pretty good, sly is okay and Bruce wills is good as always, the rest of the cast is pretty good with the exception of Dolph laundress who was pretty horrible in this film. All in all if you like 80s action flicks this movie will not disappoint but if your looking for a 3 hour long Oscar winning movie then i'd say you most likely are gonna want to skip this Big balls action flick.

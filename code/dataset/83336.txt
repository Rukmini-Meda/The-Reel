To Be Perfectly Honest The Special Effects In This Movie Were Not As Well Done As In The Last 2 Movies ... All I Can Say Is "THANK GOD FOR THAT" Because This Was 10 Times The Story The Other 2 Movies Could Have Ever Dreamed Of Being ... Those Of You Who Have Read My Movie Comments And Those Who Know Me Personally Know I Would Rather Have A Well Written Story Over Special Effects Anytime ... And This Story Was Excellently Written Worthy Of Having Been A Book Before The Movie (Unfortunately It Wasn't) ... From The Overall Theme Of Neo's "WiFi Connection" To The Matrix, The Eternal Axiom "The Enemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend" To The Spiritual Question Of Choice ... In Zion's Fight For Survival And Peace This Movie Touches On Very Important Topics In Our Own Time, Place And Lives ... I Am Most Impressed By The Writing In This Story And Offer Up My Humbly Praise ....

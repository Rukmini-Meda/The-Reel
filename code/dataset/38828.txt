This movie lives only for the success of the first part, which was pretty OK. But this movie is so ridiculous and superfluous, that I didn't want to see it again forever. I'm glad that at least Neo a.k.a. Keanu "worst Actor ever" Reeves died in the end of this horrible merchandising movie. At least I watched the whole movie only because of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne, who did a great job! But the worst thing in this movie is the fact that there isn't any (senseful) dialog and it has only the focus on "Action! Action! Action".

All in all a crappy and stupid imitativeness of the original.

I can't recommend this, anyway!

John Nash arrives at Princeton University because of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship for mathematics. Nash comes under increasing pressure to publish, but he refuses until he finds a truly original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates "every man for himself", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. This leads to a new concept of governing dynamics which Nash develops and publishes. On the strength of this he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense, to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns. He meets Alicia and marries while working at the US Department. Throughout this time he develops his schizophrenia and imagines people created by his mind. Alicia finds out that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and finally confronts Nash.

Nash is the life and inspiration of this movie. He is a dramatic character and interesting. One wonders if the voices one hears is what he heard. I recommend this movie and to understand it deeply watch it more than once.

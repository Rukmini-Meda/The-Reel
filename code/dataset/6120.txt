 (33%) Largely a misfire from Emmerich that's so overstuffed that it crumbles under its own weight leaving only a bland popcorn movie in its place. The parts between all the action are mostly tedious and dull, with its half- hearted account of typical American life offering nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times before. The the world then goes to cock leading to some amusement park style effects ride as the family drive/fly through entire cities falling down around them in a manner that wouldn't convince a 5 year old. Then the focus is on giant arks created for the wealthy classes of the world to some how live on after these terrible events, but in reality no wealthy person will hand over any money for these super arks to be built because it's such a stupid , overly elaborate idea in the first place. Overall the movie is too silly to be taken seriously, and too long and dull to be fun.

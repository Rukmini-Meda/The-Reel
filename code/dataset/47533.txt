I am both marveled and angry at this movie. Angry, mainly because it almost was the best one I have ever seen!

What kept it from getting there? Let's say those few Don Jovanni scenes that were neither important nor constructive to the plot as the whole. This makes for maybe 15-20 min. more in this movie...enough to prevent it being the greatest "chez- d'oeuvre" in film history.

It is funny that this is not about something lacking...it is about something more! What could have propelled this movie to first place was some courage in the cutting stage. Ask Frank Darabont; one of the reasons why Shawshank is still n.1!

Is Revolutions perfect? No. Does it come close? Hell yes.

This film, as well as Reloaded, has copped flak from many pop-culture soaked critics as well as the masses, due to their inability to see the genius and vision that is interwoven into this trilogy. The action is in-your-face, the symbolism is deep and enchanting - if you get it, which the majority of movie-goers do not, and that's the problem. One critic for Reloaded actually said, "I want my action films dumb and stupid" - which speaks for most of this film's Western audience. I recommend observing the Philosopher Commentaries of the 10-disc set DVD's mostly because they open up much of the hidden meanings of these films, and they show how 90% of the negative critics simply had no right to pass any kind of judgment.

See this trilogy. I can safely say that if you didn't like it, then it wasn't that the films were uninspired - it was just you, who wanted a spoon-feeding.

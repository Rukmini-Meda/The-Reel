I may sound like I am exaggerating, but this movie has, from my perspective, such a surreal complexity, that the viewer (at least me) can feel a deep and warm connection with it. I think it was made in a way to *blow* the person watching it with lots and lots of stunning imagery and dynamic action, but not in a way to overwhelm him/her, but to make he/she feel relaxed and intrigued by the worlds and characters presented. It may seem like a movie about aliens, but, from my point of view, it reflects more the human nature and behavior. This movie is for me more than mind-blowing, it is a relief to see that we, as humans, can create extraordinary fictive worlds, and not just that, but the hope that one day we could live in those kinds of realms, we could create our own version of Utopia, through collective work and passion. And now I am just excited to see Avatar 2 in 2018 as I was when I began seeing the firs part of this movie.

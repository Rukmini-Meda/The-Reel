Surprised that Hollywood would bother to make a movie about the Mayan "curse" prediction of the end of the world--First, because there really is no prediction about the end of the world, and since its past 2012 now anyway, the whole premise seems pretty childish.

The other problem is the black lead actor with the ridiculous name--First of all, he's too ugly to be in a major motion picture of this magnitude, its quite distracting--Also he's not a very good actor, and for those 2 reasons is why his career, such as it was, died. Idris Elba would have been a MUCH better choice, a black actor who has some class, as well as being British.

Otherwise, most of the other actors were fine and the CGI/Special Effects were great.

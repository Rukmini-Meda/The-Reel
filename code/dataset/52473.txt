All the stupid movie goers and Star Wars fanboys couldn't get what the film was about.

It was about Jar Jar Binks, the phantom menace. A gungan from Naboo with a troubled childhood, who was later trained in the use of the force, more accurately the dark side. He was a sith long before episode 1 and he manipulated everyone around him. He uses force jumps, mind control, martial arts. He was and maybe he is still the true Sith Lord, but thanks to the neckbeards whining after the release of the film, GL had to rewrite the movie and yet you can still catch glimpses of the true Sith Lord in attack of the clones.

He will be Supreme Leader snoke in the new movie so get ready for the hype.

You people are all blind, open your eyes!

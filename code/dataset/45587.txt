As an Mozart-admiring and yet hate and jealousy filled composer, Salieri seems to be a compelling vessel for telling us about Mozart's ingenuity - as well as his flaws. But I hope audiences realize that almost everything in this movie regarding the relationship between Mozart and Saliery is simply made up. I enjoyed the realistic depiction of the life in Vienna during that time. Also, the movie partially grants an idea of what Mozart's personality really could have been like. But the whole plot is just a fantasy of Salieri (at least the movie version of Salieri, who is plagued by feelings of guilt, jealousy and self-awareness). Should one take it metaphorically? Mozart's struggle between life and art killed him despite being one of the greatest talents. While Salieri had to outlive him despite not coming close to this genius and being fully aware of it. It's like god's punishment for movie-Salieri.

So, one has to keep in mind that this movie has actually only one historical inaccuracy: Salieri telling such a story in real life. The rest is an interesting fantasy.

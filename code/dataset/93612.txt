I loved this as a musical and Tom Hooper did an amazing job bringing the musical to the big screen. I thought all of the performances were also fantastic especially Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried because unlike the others they didn't have any musical theater background whatsoever under the belts. No Mama Mia doesn't count because it was prerecorded and used auto-tune. I doubted Crowe at first and while he wasn't amazing, he did the best he could. He simply did not have the right voice or training to play such a powerful character. Anne obviously blew everyone away. Barks was only as good as she should have been, I mean she played Eponine on stage if she wasn't as good as she was that would have been shameful. Redmayne and Jackman were strong and belted out when needed. Carter and Cohen were amazingly funny and added much needed comic relief. Overall very well done.

Side note: I hate when people say Seyfried didn't deserve the part of she wasn't good enough.

1. If you read the book Seyfried with slightly browner hair IS Cosette. From head to toe, innocent. If she didn't look the part I don't know who would because their likeness is uncanny.

2. People say she has a thin voice and cannot hold her notes. Does anyone else in the movie have such impossibly high notes?

3. Cosette and Eponine were the two most auditioned roles in the whole film and Amanda beat out apparently over 1, 769 other actresses and singers hoping for the role. So get over it!

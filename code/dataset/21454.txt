I seriously don't know what the others had expected to see from this movie. This movie has good plot, good acting, good effects and also moral values I suppose.

Although some of the scenes do not make sense, so what? As long as you enjoy it, it's a good movie, IMO.

This movie keeps me interested from the beginning to the end. It's satisfactory.

It's a good movie to watch it with your fellows and family. I gave it an 8 out of 10.

I highly recommend it.

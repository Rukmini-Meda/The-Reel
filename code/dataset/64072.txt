For both believer and non-believer, 2012 is a must-watch movie. This movie shows the unlimited power of our Creator, that can do anything on earth. How small and short our life is! Beside that it also shows the scientific advancement, human struggle to survive, love for family and dearest one. Really I think every time after watching the movie:

"who created us and why? from where we have come? what happens after death? any life more in universe? oh!"

We did not watch the Dinosaurs, Ice Age, Noah. But we have been watching WW2, WMD, Genocide, War, IS, Racism, Haughtiness and so on. If we want to save all the people of our earth, we should fight against poverty, disease, unemployment crisis. If we do not stop fighting each other, probably we will destroy ourselves before any type of real '2012 crisis'.

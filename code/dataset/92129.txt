You just cannot call this piece of garbage a worthy successor of previously made Clash of The Titans from 1981. Poorly remade story-line, excessively characters (blue genies, Io, fanatics).

What you could admire on 1981th movie, was gentle sense of humor, decently portrayed gods and charismatic actors. Here? Not even Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes can save it. Where the heck have you ever seen in Greek mythology black Pegasus f. e.? Creators were maybe deluded with their fantasies of how this newly introduced remake (same name, no try to even hide the inspiration by the 80th's "draft") will gain fans all over the world, but as years are passing, you cannot simply love or even like this movie. It rightfully belongs to movie trash, never to be brought amongst movies worth watching.

To the depths of Tartarus with everyone who helped this abomination to "silver-screen".

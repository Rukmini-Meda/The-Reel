I thought this film was absolutely brilliant, with all the actors fitting their roles perfectly. Crowe is phenomenal, you really see how hard it hurts him to find out although his mind is his best asset it is also his worst enemy. Seeing the struggle as he tries to fight it even though it's so hard is heartbreaking, and you see it's killing him to not be able to work as he wants to be recognised and have his own accomplishments. Supporting actors help pull the whole story together, Jennifer Connelly in particular I thought this was one of the best roles I've seen her in, she seems to embody the way the characters wife would feel if it was to happen to her, going through all these different emotions yet still wanting to stick by her husband through it all as it isn't his fault. Ed Harris is also a great supporting actor in this film, fitting the profile so well that you actually find it hard to believe it's all in Crowe's characters head. Many of the cast could have a mention.

I have only seen this film a few times yet every time it still amazes me and gives me goosebumps, an amazing movie, heavily recommended by me!

it's a destiny of a chosen's to get blind for a future world and them lovely lady's to get dead.

but the future world is fine machines and humans now are almost friends and there is many matrix forms and not a last so everything is okay.

and there is no agent smith anymore but there is some agents so.

matrix must get killed off smashed off and flamed off.

Morpheus is happy.

Neo is blind.

Trinity is dead.

man i love happy endings. the chosen saved us and nobody cares about chosen's life. it is a wonderful movie. just great.

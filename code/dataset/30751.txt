I've seen the first Expendables plenty of times and I still enjoy it, but I always can't help but wonder where Willis or Schwarzenegger are here. Sure they're in this movie, but for about 2-3 minutes and that's it. For a movie that's main goal is to bring together a bunch of huge action stars and have two of the biggest barely in the movie, let alone hold a weapon or kill anyone is surprising. But, I've surpassed that now, and that's why I prefer the 2nd one over this one. That's not to say this movie doesn't have something going for it.

The action is very good here and the actors compliment that. Even if we do have a comedian (Terry Crews) and a UFC fighter (Randy Couture) who aren't even really action stars, but picked more for their physical appearance or abilities. I've grown to love em' though throughout the movies especially Crews. As for the villains though I wish we had some more memorable actors. Like I don't know who the hell David Zayas is or from, and as for Eric Roberts I might have seen him before but I didn't care for him in this movie. The only decent villain was Steve Austin who's role here isn't even that big, but he managed to entertain me with his intimidating and cold, bad-ass performance as "Paine" who died in a even more bad-ass way.

I also find it ridiculous that Barney and his gang didn't want to do the mission for 5 mill because they believe they wouldn't live to spend it. But, when Barney (Stallone) meets a woman on the island who him and Christmas (Statham) attempt to bring home with them, but she refuses to go. Barney then decides all on his own he's going back for her and his gang as well also decides to tag along just for one woman that he knew for like an hour or two. I guess than there would be no action left for this film and hence that's what these guys are here for and in my opinion they did a good job of entertaining me. Even if I do wish Willis or Schwarzenegger would've got their hands dirty.

I re-watched AMADEUS recently for the first time in over twenty years and, I must say, it is pretty terrible. The characters have about as much depth as those found in Coen brothers' films; the whole Mozart-Salieri is nearly totally fictional; the sordid, soap-operish (no pun intended) relationships between virtually every character are pure Hollywood pap but most importantly (and offensively), there is NO historical basis on which to portray Mozart as an over-sexed, philandering drunkard who took nothing seriously other than his own fame. Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart's notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren't so prominent in the film I wouldn't take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn't even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called "Mozart", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce's Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.

What's that sound I hear... oh yes... it's old Wolfgang turning in his grave.

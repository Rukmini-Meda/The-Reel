I have only one word for this movie: Magnificent! This matches with the many words that appear in the trailer, which all of them starts with an "m". My favorites are "the music" and "the motion picture". What I mean with this is that this movie is kind of confusing because you must pay attention to two types of art: the movie and the music. But there is no doubt that this is a classic, a piece of art; everything is awesome and is worth watching each minute of it. Absolutely everything is beautiful and well done, the production, the performances, the direction, the costume design, the make-up, obviously the music, the cinematography, and the film editing.

 One of the best movies i've ever seen...i actually got goosebumps at certain times.I recommend this movie to everyone.It's a pity that lasts only 120 minutes..i wish it would have been longer. This review asks me to have 10 lines but i don't know what to say..i remained speechless after seeing this movie.THe characters are well chosen ,i love the time-line,the postmodern age chosen.It has that cold war-like view. I loved the role of the wife in the movie,love can heal anything.How many people can treat schizophrenia with love and support?well,she did.she managed to give his life back and to make the difference between reality and fantasies.It's a bit mind-f**k because at a certain moment you can't make the difference yourself,which fact is real?The conclusion of the movie is that where God gives too much he takes much.I never met a genius who wasn't a bit over the cuckoo's nest :)

Yes indeed, this film is the greatest piece of fiction ever to come out from any film industry I would say. The new world, their systems, their 'humans', the animals, the birds, a whole new language for God's sake! It is an amazing and out of the world piece of imagination, and I can't even begin to imagine how much of hard-work and dedication it must have required. It is the highest earning Hollywood film ever, an achievement fully deserved! Watching it for the third time in my life I went through the entire film with a smile on my face. A smile that one wears when you are really enjoying something, and I did every bit of just thinking that this dream-world is a product of someone's fantasies. It is the kind of film that I would stand up for at the end to clap in the theatre. The most impressive thing for me has to be its language. The production of those avatars just to be able to have people like them as well was quite unique I thought.

The most clever part of the film was, the person who later on turns to be one to stand in their favour and to appreciate their world, was shown as a physically disabled person, so he was in the best position to judge the physical beauty of the entirely different world. He was bound to appreciate it more just for the physical freedom and abilities that he could enjoy in it. Basically, his whole world had changed, making him automatically feel to belonging more to them than his former life and world.

The fact that we had here been thrown into an absolute new world meant that it needed for the to be as long in length as it was. So I am kind of coming up with a justification for the only flaw that I could think of.

All in all, it is stunning and more of an experience than a film, the kind of experience that I would get if I was to visit a country, or something.

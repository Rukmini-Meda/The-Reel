This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It changed my life by allowing me to experience the world in a totally different way. The visual effects, story, sound, and acting are all absolutely perfect and achieve something that no movie ever comes close. This movie has everything. It has great visual effects, a great story, awesome romance, action, acting, and directing. When I first saw it, I was thirteen years old and it gripped me. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made my heart pump. It brought about so many different emotions that are impossible to describe with words. If you haven't seen this movie, your life is automatically worse than everyone else who has. That is how good this movie is. I have seen it thirty seven times now and every time has been just as good as the last, save for the first viewing which was absolutely amazing. The second viewing of this movie was better than the first viewing of my second favorite movie, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. And that movie is unbelievably amazing.

I can under stand many of the complaints about this movie, but I think most people come up with complaints based on others. Recently the prequel trilogy has been receiving bad criticism by many who hardly know what they're talking about. When this movies was newer it(along with the other prequels)was looked upon as better and more exciting than the original trilogy. I knew many many kids who hardly cared about the original trilogy but was obsessed with the prequels. I think many of these individuals have changed their opinions because of what others think about it. I think if you stop comparing it to the originals, which i equally agree are superior,you will realize it is an amazing movie with great characters and settings. The beautiful thing about the phantom menace is that you get to see how the events in the original trilogy came into place.

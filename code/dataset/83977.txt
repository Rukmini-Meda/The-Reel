I just want to start out saying this movie sucks. Rarely does a movie make me mad, but this movie made me furious. The action sucked, the acting sucked, the comic relief sucked and the 3D was so bad I took of the glasses off to make it more interesting. The only thing that could have saved this movie was Leam Neson yelling "release the Crakin", but i could have just stayed home and saved 12 dollars. Maybe I'm so mad,

because I paid extra money for a pair of glasses, because there was no 3d whatsoever. Whoever made this movie stole my money and they should never make another movie again. Please do not see this movie, do not buy this movie, do not rent this movie, don't ever speak of this movie ever.

Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made. Way beyond its time, it ticks the list of what every film should be looking to achieve if they want to make a great film. Undeniably, a classic and will never become something you find boring to watch. When people tell me they didn't like it because it was too long, I feel like never talking to them again. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, two of the greatest actors to have ever lived. And a score to stick with you until the end. A classic for the ages.

I very much enjoy watching films like this. Watching Avatar made me feel like i was on a trip to another world. The technique in this movie that made the world come together was phenomenal. From the makeup to the made up language to the physical world and the life in that world itself. I was surprised every time something new popped up. Even though there was so much to see in the movie i felt that there was still a whole world to be discovered.

First of all what can you expect from James Cameron...whenever i listen that Cameron is directing this movie and that movie.i already know that it will be a masterpiece.Avatar yet again proved it.What a piece of gem this movie is. Technically awesome,what a visual effects,animation and sound effects....This movie will completely take over your emotions for whole 3 hours.....It keeps you intact and curious till the end...What a concept has been delivered and with what an efficiency...That jungle world and whole Pandora and its creatures,every thing seems real...Its a piece of entertainment which will never lose its colors whatever the age it is..it has engraved its name on our hearts for eternity..A lesson for humans also...to respect our dear Earth,we will never find a more better home than this.If we ever do,we will be thrown out just like what happens in this movie.. But,clearly a movie worth watching..If anyone misses this one,he should understand that utter misfortune has hit him....

After watching this movie.. even though I am not great thinker.. I started respecting my thoughts. Freedom for thoughts is really food for innovation.

It doesn't matter whether the thought becomes reality ..for being evident to the people of this world..or it just remains as thought.. a great thought, beautiful thought or a stupid thought.. but it still remains.

Movie makes this realize on every stage of the existing of the beautiful thought in ones life and when it becomes reality.. its 'Beauty' comes to reality..

Awesome Movie !

This movie starts in 1947 Princeton where John Nash (Russell Crowe) is trying to start his career. He is not impressed with anybody else there, and searches for an original idea. He is awkward and very peculiar. Then one night at a bar, a tall blonde and her friends walk in. It gives him an idea to overturn Adam Smith's theory. This allows him a placement in the Wheeler Labs in MIT. Years later working at MIT, he meets student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) who would eventually become his wife, and the mysterious William Parcher (Ed Harris) from the DOD.

Russell Crowe has been a leading man for awhile but this one proves once and for all his versatility. He is amazing throughout giving a praise worthy performance. Jennifer Connelly makes a great entrance as she shows her brains as well as her beauty. Director Ron Howard is spot on with this movie. He allows Crowe the space to lead. It's a very human character. It's the best picture Oscar winner for a good reason.

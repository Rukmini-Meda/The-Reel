Pros: -- Superb CGI, -- Amazing planet -- Mysterious World (with so many unanswered questions that are still left to be answered in other sequels) -- Original Alien Life (So much better than the retarded looking aliens in Star Wars)

Cons: -- A very familiar plot (just happens to be on another planet) -- Weak Acting

In a nutshell, going forward, Avatar needs a new plot line. The familiar story of whites driving Indians from their native land is too boring. The sequels need to dive much deeper into the Alien way of life and the whole mystical spiritual side of their existence. Maybe, instead of white men being the evil, their is some kind of evil within we can learn about? Because if we keep expanding the original plot , of white men trying to take blue monkeys' gold and kill them off for profit, I can already see this franchise going into abyss.

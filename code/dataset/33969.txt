 Hmmm...with all the action movie stars ever starring in an action movie you'd expect something special, but you'd be wrong. The Expendables is as loud, dumb and flashy as you'd expect, but it's just no fun. Surprisingly, there's not much action in it neither, well, not nearly as much as I expected. The fight scenes were pretty lousy too; you couldn't see what anybody was doing and when you could see they were pretty unspectacular and uninspired. I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite Mixed-Martial Artists - Randy Couture - in hand-to-hand combat, but he hardly fought, in fact he was hardly in the movie. For a movie that boasts all the action stars ever, shouldn't we be going from set-piece to set- piece that showcases the things that we made us love these action stars in the first place? All in all, I never expected Oscar-worthy material, but for an action movie and given the action talent on hand it was really unoriginal, uninspired and just plain boring. But still, at least it's better than Prometheus!

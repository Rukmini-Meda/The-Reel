We thought this movie absolutely stunk! The plot was terrible; it is narrated by some old, suicidal guy, I don't trust him. Amadeus was one of the worst movies my eyes have ever witnessed. I thought the way they portrayed Wolfgang as a self centered, obnoxious, barbarian was atrocious. There are so many historical inaccuracies. We even had an assignment to prove these unacceptable embellishments.

As for the acting, It was OK a little dramatic at times. Also the costume design was hideous. I read online from a trusted source that Wolfgang very rarely wore wigs; in the movie he wore elaborate colored wigs. I also thought that Salieri was a jerk, Well at least he was in the movie...

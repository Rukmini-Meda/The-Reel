 Great acting captures the passion these classical performers had for music. Stupendous performances and a gripping story. It is quite inspiring to witness the life of Mozart and see how undervalued a man of such talent was. It shows the jealousy and bitterness of people around us deterring us from achieving greatness. They dynamic between the actors is very nuanced and captures the complex relationship often experienced in life. This movie is a classic that will stand the test of time. It also reveals a alternate view on the classical performance world that most people don't know about. It is quite educational in addition to entertaining.

 OMG! Till today i thought that 2012 was the bomb, but after what i've just witnessed i can't really say that with all certainty anymore. This movie just blew my brains out of my head and straight on the floor! I could not, for the life of me, notice a single coherent line in the whole chaotic mess that is, very liberally, called this movies "storyline". If i watch this as a cinematic film piece that should make sense and perfect logic, then, no, this is not a very good cinematic film piece, but if i watch it as an epic video game intro, which it is, then - whoa!! The main character gets shield upgrades, new weapons, skills, a gang of skilled fighters. He voyages and encounters big bosses for which he must use different tactics. CotT is in fact a clever RPG movie filed with INSANE amounts of epic. Epic hot chicks, epic soldier stone smile, epic jinn or whatever the hell he is, epic black F***ING Pegasus, none of that white sissy stuff flies here, epic Kraken that we see only for less than a minute in the movie, epic lines like "Don't look this bitch in the eye.", epic black Pegasus running on the beach in slow-mo. This s*** is epic. 10/10

 This film has it all; great casting, great costume designs, a great soundtrack, great directing, great writing and the list goes on. Every bit to be taken in and considered brilliantly executed. I could watch this movie over and over again always finding, within it, something I hadn't seen before. It is one that stays with you long after the final credits run. It is a long movie but well worth the watch. I recommend this movie for a cultural experience. A great story line with attention to the developing characters and their relationships. Thoroughly insightful and entertaining at the same time. I do find Amadeus, a story about Mozart, to be brilliant executed and would highly recommend this film. Author Kat McMann

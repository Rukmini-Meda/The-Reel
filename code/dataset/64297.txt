I know I'm more than likely in the minority with this, but I like this movie a lot. I know it has it's problems but it still holds a special place in my heart. If you look at this movie from the perspective of it being the very first entry in the series (with nothing else to go off of) it sets the stage very well for the other 5 films. It may have it's ridiculous moments, like Anakin's autopilot conveniently taking him where he needs to go, and the conflict isn't as strong as other entries, but I can look past those things. I know this movie has gotten a lot of flack from supposed Star Wars fans, but I wonder how many of them actually saw it. I feel like all the hate for this stems not from people seeing it, but rather people watching "die-hard fans" dissect the movie and all of it's faults. These people then take others opinions as their own, and spread the hatred for this movie blindly. I have no evidence to back this up, that's just what I feel. Also, I don't find Jar Jar Binks annoying. I think the amount of hate people have for him is just them trying to find more faults with the film. And yes, Jake Lloyd isn't the best child actor, but I can't name many child actors that are Oscar worthy, can you? He didn't deserve to be harassed and given death threats by "die-hard fans". In conclusion, is this the best Star Wars movie? No. Do I think it's a good enough start to one of my favorite franchises of all time? Yes. If you haven't already, give this film a try with an open mind, you just might like it. Or you can watch angry fanboys with way too much time on their hands completely destroy the movie in videos that are 2 hours long. I'm sorry, but anyone that takes that much time to talk about how much they hate something, needs to get a life.

May the Force be with you.

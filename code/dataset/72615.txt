The end of the world has never been so fun, nor has it ever been captured on film quite like this.

2012 is far from a perfect film, but it takes the disaster genre and amps it up ten fold. The script is light, but it does a nice job of setting the stakes and not confusing the viewer. The film builds the story at a good pace and pays off just at the right moments.

We get to know the characters we are supposed to and then all hell breaks lose. The special effect in 2012 are worth the price of admission alone.

2012 is the kind of film where you must suspend belief at the door. There are things that will happen in this film that are just impossible to take seriously, you just have to deal with it. It's a movie.

The bright spot of the film is Chiwetel Ejiofor. He also happens to be the heart and sole. Without his presence, the film would struggle for that emotional connection that is paramount in any disaster flick.

Chiwetel Ejiofor has been in some very good films including Children of Men, The Inside Man and American Gangster. He is an actor to keep an eye on.

In the end, if you are the kind of person that has trouble separating fiction from reality, then you should probably stay away from 2012. On the other hand, if your a sucker for disaster movies and just want a fun time at the theater for the price of a ticket and some snacks, then 2012 is where it's at.

Enjoy. The end is near.

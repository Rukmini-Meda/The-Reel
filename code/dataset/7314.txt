Enjoyable in small doses but overall as pointlessly unoriginal as you'd expect.

This movie is basically founded on the premise that if you put together as ensemble cast of action heroes from Stallone's phone book, what could possibly go wrong?

Makes sense to me.

But sadly, I discovered that without a half-decent plot to speak of (I've honestly forgotten what the 'plot' was meant to be - something about drugs in Mexico I think) or any real originality in the action sequences, watching Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li kick ass repeatedly actually can be rather dull. I must be getting old.

It's an OK way to wile a way an evening I suppose, if you've got it to hand and there's nothing else on. That's as much as I can say in its favour.

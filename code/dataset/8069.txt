Bollywood action movies of the last century make a Hollywood comeback.

Seriously ridiculous movies both expendables. if it is deliberate then great spoof, if it was meant to be taken seriously then *face palm fail*.

Just loud, brass, obnoxious, crude, ridiculous, and corny. The fight scenes remind me of something out of a Bollywood Rajnikunth movie, where an old man beats up a hundred people with machine guns with nothing but his hands and fist, without getting shot or scratched at all. Whilst doing ridiculously corny cool poses and tough guy lines.

If this was a movie done by anyone other than big Hollywood names, it would be laughed out of the box office as a pile of tripe.

But the big names, make it a big movie.

Entertaining enough, but nothing special. A 6 at best when history will look back on it.

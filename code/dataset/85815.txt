Greetings from Lithuania.

"2012" is a very solid entry into disaster movies genre. It has everything that one would like to have: great special effects, tons of action, larger than life main characters and destructions on a biblical scale. Hey, it's surely isn't the best picture of the year, but it does exactly what it promises, entertains us by showing end of the world and 2 dimensional characters trying to survive it. The master of these flicks Roland Emmerich have destroyed cities in the past pictures, but here he goes on total annihilation.

Overall, if you have somehow skipped this flick on it's release, you can safely check this one out you like disaster flicks in general, because "2012" has it all.

Les Miserables is a movie set in 19th-century France about a man, Jean Valjean, who agrees to raise a factory worker's daughter. It's based on the musical of the same name which is in turn based on the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo. It stars an ensemble cast led by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter.

All the actors deliver an excellent performance, both acting and singing, especially Hathaway. But the movie felt unnecessarily long, especially all the singed monologues. The diagonal camera angle and extreme close ups were a bit distracting.

There were parts that didn't make sense. For example, why did Fantine bring an incriminating letter to work for no reason? Or how did Marius and Cosette fall in love so quickly? There's another one that I can't mention without spoiling the movie, but it's in the first act.

It would've been nice to see the plot drive the movie instead of the music driving the whole movie. It felt more of an opera than a musical.

Until now, i'm still amazed by this film. Planet Pandora is so beautiful, stir my imagination. The story is good, not too complicated and easy to digest, but also not too flat. Cool war equipment design. The film also represents life in the real world, where the big companies are always trying to gain an advantage in every way, no matter it is lawful or unlawful, damage or no damage; the most important thing for them is their own profit. Yes ... the struggle of Jake and his friends against greedy RDA describe the events in the real world today.

In conclusion, a great story, cool the equipment design, the beauty of the planet Pandora which soothes the eye and the imagination. Really entertaining movie goers and not upset.

Sorry for my English.

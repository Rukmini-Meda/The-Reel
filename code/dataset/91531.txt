John Forbes Nash Jr. is brilliant but an arrogant and conceited professor.He seems guaranteed a rosy future in the early '50s after he marries beautiful student Alicia and makes a remarkable advancement in the foundations of "game theory" which carries him to the brink of international acclaim. Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher, from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best as he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity. Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize.

Director Ron Howard has created a moving masterpiece, elegantly guiding the audience through John Forbes Nash Jr.'s life as it shows the triumph and tragedy of life, as well as the beauty of the human spirit to overcome and survive.Also,it one significant movie since it is uplifting, thought-provoking, and emotionally devastating look on both a love story and mental illness.And most of all,it is beautifully acted particularly by Connelly and Crowe,who completely disappears into the character of Nash which is one reason alone why this is a for highly recommended viewing.

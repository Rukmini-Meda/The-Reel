an interesting, offbeat subject; crowe good but i found too much the blubblering; reminded me of derek jacoby overdoing claudius; we get that he's an antisocial math genius, and that story line would have been more interesting with more quirkiness- like the great scene where he asks his date to name anything, then finds it in the stars; fanciful but wonderful; so in a way it's a solid 8, except for a major flaw, i.e. that too much of what's shown as real isn't; if you don't pick up on that it's given about 1:20 into the movie, but by then you're wondering if that is being imagined, too; is it only characters present when he's present? there is exactly the same level of detail in the schizoid scenes as the real scenes- and that's not the way paranoid schizophrenia works, aside from confusing what's real and imagined; point is it's too much like movies that late in the game show that it's all a dream; minor role but very nice and unaffected jennifer connoly

 John Nash is a quiet, introverted man. A brilliant person who doesn't quite fit in. His roommate Charles is always there to help him get through the difficult times in his life at university. Russell Crowe is, again fantastic in portraying John Nash. With Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia and Paul Bettany as his roommate Charles, this film sets up to be a great film about the success of a gifted person. Unfortunately that is not how things progressed. John Nash's mind leads him down a self-destructive path that neither friends or family can save him from. With espionage and government intervention around every corner it is impossible to know which way to turn. Ed Harris is excellent as Parcher, the dark government agent who, it seems, hires Nash to work at a secret government facility to help decode vital information. Directed by Ron Howard ( Robin Hood,3:10 to Yuma and Apollo 13 ), A Beautiful Mind is one of the few movies based on a real life, that actually translates into A Beautiful Movie.

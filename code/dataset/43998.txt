- Avatar proves that you don't even need human beings to bring a movie into life. Everything in this movie looks so beautiful, the nature of "Pandora" is so magnificent. From the plants and the creatures to the race of Na'vi, everything has a soul and feels alive.

- Every character in the movie is awesome, the good and the bad guys. - The protagonist did an awesome job but the award must go to Zoe Saldana (playing: Neytiri), she was excellent.

- The movie is almost 3 hours long...and you would expect to be tired by the end, but NO, the film doesn't feel so long. The story flows so smooth.

- This is probably my favorite sci-fi movie set in the future. Not even one flaw found in the movie.

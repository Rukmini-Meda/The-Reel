 Everyone thought this may be a flop due to all the stars within it, like a clash of ego's but they worked so well and such a great film Stallone was a genius within this Terry Crews is just a great actor and great whatever he is in Jet Li brought a contrast of what strength is Jason i am not usual a fan of but was a great addition to this movie It has just improved more and more on each film released the more stars the more risk but so fan they have done so well Well Done on the film and a Great story line. I now just have to fill the rest because apparently I haven't written enough, Lucky i haven't written any spoilers within this otherwise my account would be blocked lol.

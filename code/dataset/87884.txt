This is yet another remake of an old movie that, for some reason, has fallen by the wayside. I've never seen the original so I'm not the best person to compare. The film essentially tells the Greek myth of Perseus. The cast is led by Sam Worthington, who did a satisfying job in the action scenes but was unable to concede some psychological depth to his character. Much better on that was Liam Neeson, who played Zeus, or even Ralph Fiennes, who gave life to the grudging Hades in a way that makes clear that he was uncomfortable with his character. In fact, I was wondering if any resemblance between this Hades and Lord Voldemort was mere coincidence or whether Fiennes recycled into the mythical character the voice and manners of the villain of the Harry Potter franchise. But this can even be forgiven when we observe the performance of Gemma Arterton, unable to move a muscle of the face. Her character looks like a dead doll.

I think the actors are not to blame. Its the fault of Louis Leterrier, who decided to make a film that is visually incredible but without any emotion, feeling or depth. When will filmmakers finally understand that a lot of CGI is not enough to make a good movie? Even if it's good CGI, that's never enough! The screenwriters also failed, as the script is absolutely saltless and made the movie insipid. Nothing that is insipid tastes good. It takes salt, seasoning, and this is done, at least in the movies, with emotion and depth. This movie can even entertain us well, it really manages to do it. But it had everything to be even better if the director and writers had worked harder.

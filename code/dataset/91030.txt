Who are the Wachowski brothers fooling ? After delivering "Matrix", which rightfully became a world wide success, they immediately claimed that they had had the concept for three films right from the beginning. HAHA ! What had already started with "Matrix Reloaded" - a lot of people were disappointed but still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt - has now reached an absolute nadir. "Matrix Revolutions" is an incoherent, jumbled, meaningless mess that has to be seen to be believed ! Approach with extreme caution !!!

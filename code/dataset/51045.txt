Just re watched Episode I again and it was actually better this time (a little). Jar Jar Binks is absolutely one of the most dumbest characters in movie history there were 2 scenes that he could die easily and he didn't why? why George Lucas? Instead they killed Liam Neeson who by the way was a pretty good character and Darth Maul was a great villain too bad he was cut in half. The acting isn't something special, the cgi is not that great and the script/direction not that good either some actors don't even want to be here like Keira Knightley. The humor was another big issue for me because it was mostly from Jar Jar who killed his enemies by accident most of the time. I was around a 7.5 but i give it an 8 because of the Obi Wan & Qui Gon Jinn v.s Darth Maul battle that was one of the best scenes from the movie by far.

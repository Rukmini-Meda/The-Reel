Les Miserables is a 2012 movie adaptation of the popularized French historical novel written by Victor Hugo. The movie was directed by Tom Hooper with its celebrity casts Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Russel Crowe as Javert, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette and many more. The movie adaptation is an epic romantic, musical period drama film produced by Working Title Films and distributed by Universal Pictures.

Les Miserables is a musical theater that can captivate every soul. I watched the movie without any idea about its story line though it is often used as an example in MAPEH subject. Watching it gave me goose bumps. The story itself is fantastically written that gave tingles to my spine watching the whole story. So many things happened in a single musical theater but everything was portrayed very well. From Jean Valjean held captive until he became the father of Cosette is truly heartwarming. Anne Hathaway shone with her beautiful voice as well as Hugh Jackman which is a real shocking, well, for me. I knew him as Wolverine and I never imagined him singing wonderful and dramatic songs for a musical film. Hands up for the casts of this film and a big salute for all of them.

The pacing of the movie was quite slow but it gave the story a more mysterious vibe letting the audience feel excited about what would happen next. The angles are very well shot and clear though some scenes have a bit dim lighting which made it hard to see.

Nevertheless, I personally love the film and the story itself. It made a tremendous impact to me which made me cry buckets of tears on the last scene. Every character portrayed their roles very well as if you're watching a real life tragic story that would make each heart break. I would certainly recommend this movie for those people who love historical and musical theaters. Everything is beautiful and it really deserved the awards it received years ago. A terrific work of art indeed.

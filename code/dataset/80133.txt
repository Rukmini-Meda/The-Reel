 Please take this advice before viewing the turgid nonsense that is Les Miserables. This effort makes Miss Saigon look like the wackiest comedy ever. I have honestly never seen such a depressing sight since my last tax demand. Hopefully everyone concerned with this production was offered counselling. By the time Javert decided to end it all by jumping into the swirling waters, I was on my feet ready to push him. Director Tom Hooper should have told young Daniel Huttlestone ( Gavroche ) that he was no longer playing a part in "Oliver." His cockney accent in the middle of Paris was ridiculous. " Stone the Russell Crowes guv. You wouldn't Adam and Eve it" Hope anyone who viewed this in the cinema went on Orange Wednesday 2 for 1. At least this would be a small compensation.

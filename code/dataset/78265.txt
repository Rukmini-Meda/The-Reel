I rated this movie a 10, only because it kind of reflected what I have dreamed about for very long: humans' having to remember that they belong to nature and not vice versa, following a fatal confrontation with every element of nature. I have gone further in my dreams, following all this to total destruction of mankind.

The depiction of the many cycles of life through the connection between nearly every living thing except of course us humans was breathtaking. I loved it. I loved the idea of plugging in my hair to a beautiful tree to communicate to Mother Earth. It was the first and only 3D movie I had seen and because it's been a couple of years since I watched it, some of what I said above may sound as if it's just reconstructive memory. Don't know, don't care.

I am biased because it was an enchanting tale-like version of my dream that I saw up there on the screen. I'd rather the movie didn't have all those American cliches which kind of stained it-you don't have to make your characters fall in love with one another to make a story interesting; in fact, most of the time,it does the opposite, making it sound insincere. In this instance, it felt like the whole planet would have been destroyed had not the protagonist fallen in love with Zaldana's character. I chop off a movie's rating greatly when I come across abhorrent stuff like that, this one is an exception.)

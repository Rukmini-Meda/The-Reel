Avatar is visually fantastic , plus the story of the film is hardly as spectacular , the script is just good, and the dialogues are not striking , the cast is good, more the performances are just OK , the story is even cool, nothing else surprisingly , the soundtrack is good , the direction of James Cameron is good, more is hardly the direction of Terminator 2 and Titanic , the special effects are excellent , Pandora Visual is amazing, the action scenes are good, especially the end , the dramatic moments is weak , most have really nice moments , Visual creatures on Pandora is also positive , Avatar impresses visually , more leaves to be desired in performances and drama, action scenes are good , more does not excite , and has no Cameron inspired as in Terminator 2 is a more important film, particularly the use of 3D.

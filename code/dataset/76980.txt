 There is so much of this movie that is historically inaccurate, it's almost hard to watch for someone that knows their facts. That being said, this movie is fantastic. The actor performances are wonderful, all of the music is extremely well done, the entire movie is... well... awesome. It is for that reason I give this movie 9/10 stars. Sure, they took a lot of liberties with the story, but those liberties worked extremely well in making to movie really interesting and really good. I was surprised at how much I liked both Salieri and Mozart. Flaws go a long way in making a character endearing. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good drama.

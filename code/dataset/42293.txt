Watching this classic in a theater only solidifies it's place as my #1 all-time favorite film.

Not a false note in the film. The setting is superb, the mood is subtle and effective, the music adds to the feelings.

But the acting...oh, the acting!

Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Casales, Keaton, Vigoda all at the top of their games.

But...Brando...on another level entirely as Don Vito Corleone. A performance for the ages.

Bravo...everyone...Bravo!

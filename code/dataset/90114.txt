Avatar was totally robbed at the Oscars that year by the silly movie 'hurt locker' about a bomb that might or might not go off.... such a boring shallow move. Avatar is a better movie, a huge achievement.

Avatar creates a new world and fills it with amazing spectacle. The message in the story is important, if simplistic but worthwhile.

Reflecting our own world where progress and greed impose on nature and threatens what is irreplaceable.

As we wrestle with our own environmental catastrophes and responsibilities, it's movies like this we need more of that remind us of our origin, mission, and choices.

Good solid original entertainment, Avatar demands a big high definition screen and full HD viewing. It does what other films only try to do, and that's take you on a journey away from everything for two hours, with action, suspense and technically fantastic visuals.

The one criticism worth mentioning is that some of the dialogue is typical cheesy Hollywood, and feels too safe. It's as if they went for "standard" dialogue because they didn't want to detract from the surrounding visuals. That was a mistake. They should have refined the script and made it more intelligent, with added depth to some of the story elements. That can all be forgiven however, because of the enormous scope and creativity of this great movie.

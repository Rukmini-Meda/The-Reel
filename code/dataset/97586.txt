The special effects and action of this movie doesn't even up with the second, and of course doesn't approach the groundbreaking level of the first. But the action sequences are still intense and fun to watch, especially the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith.

This movie actually requires you to listen to the dialogue like the second one, which seemed to disappoint all the 12 year-olds in the screening I went to. The movie brings together all the elements of choice, good and evil(ying and yang), and the differences and similarities between human emotions and machine functions. All in all I think this third installment of the Matrix series really has a satisfying finish, even if it was less visually dazzling.

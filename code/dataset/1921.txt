I don't understand all the hype for this movie. Sure it is visually compelling but as a whole I find it to be too strange and also too boring. How this movie made so much money is a marvel because this movie reminds me of what Battlefield Earth's potential could have been. The biggest problem with this movie is that I never felt a connection to the people of Pandora and I agreed with the Colonel. I think that Jake Sully was very ungrateful for the chance to go here and that he is a traitor for not carrying out the mission. You know a movie fails when you are hoping that the so called "good guys" are the ones that you want to die. Overall, I do not understand why this movie made so much money and was able to such a success.

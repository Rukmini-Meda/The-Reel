I don't want to waste time writing a review.

Bering, slow, pointless , plot less movie. I don't even remember any dialogues. may be

"Dont say you are innocent, it insults my intelligence" and of of course the famous ":Am going to make an offer which he cannot refuse"

Its hard to understand what Marlon Brando is talking. Total waste of time. Main god father, with whom they sold the movie, gets shot, admitted and does not appear for quite a longer time and finally he dies. What a joke!!!

Al pacino was sleepy, sluggish, and crying.

Slept twice while seeing the movie.

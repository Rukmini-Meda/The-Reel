Okay, I know this was not the best conclusion to the trilogy. It's very underrated. I watched it the other day, and thought that the main reason that people didn't like it was that it wasn't fully explained. Did Trinity die, did Neo die, what happened to everybody in the end, who cares! Can't you people see that the Wachowski's want people to make it up for themselves. I think that it's a really good way to end the series. It's a great way to end the series. The Neo/Smith fight was probably the coolest fight in the entire series. I thought the whole Bane/train station subplot were good. I thought that the entire movie was pretty gripping, and the entire battle for Zion was great. The only thing I didn't like really like was that they didn't go into the Matrix as much. It was only the opening with the train station bit, and the final Smith battle. I liked this movie. It wasn't as horrible as everybody else says. I liked it a lot. So, if you saw the first two and like them, then see this one. Don't expect it to be as good as the first two, but you will like it. I know you will.

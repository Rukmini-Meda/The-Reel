Good movie but not the BEST.

The special effects were OK, some of them looked really fake.

I know it's an action movie and the principal cast are supposed to survive 'till the end of the movie but come on, were they supernatural or what? Only few scratches after all they went through. The bridges and buildings falling down and they passed in the car with no problem. It could be a little more realistic without all the drama: "we survive to everything no matter what".

I suffered a lot watching this movie, I was struggling with myself to not cry, it's very cruel and it's sad imagine all this could really happen, see how everyone dies, everything is destroy and it shows once again how the people in this world thinks: the money and being an "important" person can save your life, the rest of us does not matter.

It's also a wake up call to everyone who lives in this planet.

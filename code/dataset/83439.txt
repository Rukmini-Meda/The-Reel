 I've seen and enjoyed this play a couple of times. But I really did not enjoy this version in the least. The main question that comes to my mind is why in God's name was Russell Crowe cast in this? His singing is truly awful! Jackman is only slightly better. Other than Anne Hathaway, the singers suck. This hurt my ears to the point that the director should be shot for casting them. The dark visuals are appropriate, though it does tend to drag on and on in the darkness. Of course, this is not a bright and happy play, so I don't expect this to be happy or anything. But it shouldn't hurt my ears, and, in fact the other performances have been sonically pleasant to my ears.

The Wachowski Brother's thrilling sci-fi action trilogy comes to an end. High expectations may have not been met; but the story line is surely wrapped up to the satisfaction of the MATRIX cultish following. Neo(Keanu Reeves)finds himself trapped between the "real" world and the computer-generated Matrix. Neo must put together riddles from the Oracle(Mary Alice)in order to strike a bargain with Agent Smith(Hugo Weaving)in the machine city to save Zion from obliteration. Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne)come to Neo's aid as a battle rages with swarms of tentacled mechanical sentinels. The grand finale is Neo's final confrontation in a driving rain with numerous Agent Smiths. Strong forward momentum from beginning to end. Adrenaline pumps at a fever pitch throughout this CGI spectacle. Also appearing in this explosive epic: Jada Pinkett Smith, Nona Gaye, Zeke Castelli, Nathaniel Lees and Monica Bellucci.

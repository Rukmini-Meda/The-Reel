 So let's see... you risk your life and the lives of your companions to journey to Hell to cut off the head of one of the most horrific creatures in world literature so you can rush back to Argos just in time to protect an extraordinarily beautiful woman from yet another of the most horrific creatures in world literature; and in the process she falls into the ocean and you dive into it to save her (automatically winning every episode of FEAR FACTOR ever filmed) and when the two of you come back to consciousness on the sandy beach that you washed up on, you utter the most perfect pickup line in history , "I SERVE YOU BETTER AS A MAN" and given all that has gone before, it pretty much gets her attention. Now, as to the movie, I really don't understand what all these armchair critics were expecting, it is easy to become jaded and cynical in a world of CGI, but having seen more films that I care to admit I will gently point out this film is technically perfect, maintains pace, is well-acted and generally delivers well on its promise of a near-spectacle, the likes of which we have not seen since the 1950s. If you were expecting Star Wars XXV or another Matrix, tough. This film will be entertaining your grandchildren long after your criticisms have, like the Kraken, turned to dust.

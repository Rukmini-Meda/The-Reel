To say The Expendables is one of the best action films in this decade is not saying much as there really have not been many good action films in the last few years with many straight to video fodder.

Sylvester Stallone decides to go back to his 1980s glory days by rounding up a group of a current and past action stars including cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Stallone who looks in good physical shape thanks to the steroids but his face looks awful courtesy of bad plastic surgery leads the teams of big hearted mercenaries. Jason Statham, is the cockney knife thrower, Jet Li is the short ass Kung Fu one, Dolph Lundgren is the mean drug addicted one, Mickey Rourke is the philosopher/tattooist. Terry Crews and Randy Couture round up the team.

The CIA hires The Expendables to eliminate a Latin American dictator and a renegade CIA agent (Eric Roberts). Stallone gets close to the rebellious daughter of the dictator and Roberts has a few nasty henchman of his own such as Steve Austin.

There is a lot of good action sequences but it has a slight storyline. Some very good explosions but the climactic scenes shot in the dark makes it difficult to see what is actually happening unless you have those night vision goggles.

Its a fun, no brainer action film. More enjoyable first time round but really does not stand up to repeated viewing. Its the best of the The Expendables franchise as it offers something fresh and the sequels got stale rather quickly.

After a brilliant but asocial mathematician (Russell Crowe) accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish.

I was sold when Nash began expounding on Adam Smith, and how everyone acting in their own self-interest works best for all. Effectively, he made a good argument for price fixing... only applied to dating. His thoughts on game theory are pretty incredible.

The story gets more interesting as Nash gets more mentally ill. It is in many ways a precursor to "The Imitation Game" (2014), and both are excellent films about mathematicians. Maybe not a great double feature, but excellent for comparison.

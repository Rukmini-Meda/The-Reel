Clash of the Titans goes to show the importance of a good story for a movie, even if it is a couple of thousands of years old. Of course, if you're awaiting an ancient Greek myth brought to screen you'd be disappointed.

As far as i understood there has been a whole genre called sword-and-sandal or similar which were basically historical epics. I even remember seeing several of those as a child, at a time when The Lord of the Rings has been merely fantasy aficionado's literature. Although old, they have definitely offered stories different from my ordinary movies at a time, despite the outdated special effects.

Given the strong story you might expect that contemporary CGI might help improve the viewers' experience, but you'd be just partially right. CGI is superb in Clash of the Titans, yet we've seen a whole bunch of it when the aforementioned The Lord of the Rings turned mainstream, thanks to Peter Jackson's adaptation. And all the mythical creatures are but a fraction of the fauna populating the worlds we've seen afterwards.

Eventually, we've been left with a Hollywood blockbuster full of half-witted dialog and superior CGI.

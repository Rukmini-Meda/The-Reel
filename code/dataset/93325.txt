Who knows if Sylvester Stallone is actually the source of the idea to bring all these old geezers together, but whoever it was deserves a Nobel Peace Prize Medal. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) leads a group of mercenaries. Jason Statham has some fun jokey chemistry as Lee Christmas. Jet Li is the martial arts expert. Terry Crews is firing off big weapons. The other muscle heads include Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Steve Austin.

The story really doesn't matter much. Sly is actually a very competent action director. And it's great to see these guys do what they naturally like to do. It is a rocking hard action nostalgic walk down memory lane.

Before I went to see this movie I read many articles in certain papers saying that this movie was not all it is cranked up to be.After seeing the movie for myself,I realise that you should'nt judge a film on what the majority of articles have to say about it.

This film is packed with a great story line,written with great imagination and depth.Whilst watching this film you find yourself putting all the pieces of the film's puzzle in your mind.This is down to the fact that the film is explained in great detail,every aspects of the films outputs are all greatly put together so that it makes it easier for you to understand.I say this because in the second one,many people were baffled as to what the film message was trying to say (espeicially at the end!) so that is what makes this film enjoyable.

I'm not going to say too much about the movie itself but i'll just say the actions scenes are magnificent and the ending is...........something you will have to see for yourself!

Shame on John Cusack for taking on the main role in this movie - must have needed for money!!! The storyline is ridiculous enough, but the CGI is really just laughable.

I would like to think this movie was made as a spoof of this genre, but horrifyingly it wasn't!!! Every cliche in the book was featured in this movie - including risking personal life for the sake of a beloved dog!!!

The acting is pretty dire from everyone! The movie really is an insult to most people's intelligence and should be avoided at all costs. I thought Jupiter Ascending was bad, but I'm not sure whether this one outdoes that!!!!! Personally I'm not going to waste my time pondering that thought!

Great film. The story is realistic that follows the real life of John Forbes Nash Jr, a math genius that suffered over the years due to schizophrenia. He is one of the few famous lunatics, and could saw the world in a way that we no one could imagine. What surprised me the most is that he overcame the mental disease by his will and after fierce battles with his inner self, he won the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his game theory in economic.

During the hard time, his wife, Jennifer Connelly. The perfect lady who had a beautiful mind hadn't giving up him all the time, and saw him through the illness. Nash gave a acceptance speech as follows when he won the Nobel Prize.

"I've always believe in numbers, in the equation and logics that lead to reason, but after a lifetime of search pursuits, I ask, what truly is logic, who decides reason, my quest has taken me through physical and metaphysical, the delusional, and back. And I have made the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of my life, it is only in the mysterious equation of love, that any logical reasons can be found, I am only here because of you, you are the reason I am, you are all my reasons."

Clash of the titans is a free adaptation of the myth of Perseus, which in the better case won't get you bored but not much more. The story is a mixture of Greek myths connected by a very weak plot and not much better acting and special effects. It is a remake of the homonym film made in 1981.

It tells the journey of Perseus in order to find a way to stop the kraken that gods have summoned to destroy the city of Argos and save the princess Andromeda who has been offered as a sacrifice.

The best of the film is the presence of Ralph Fiennes in the role of Hades, the worst, everything else. If you look for a film to keep you entertained without thinking at all or to have as background while you do anything else it might be a good option.

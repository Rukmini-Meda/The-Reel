Warning: military Types Won't Like This This is the best war film about the victims I have ever seen. Cameron makes one of his greatest films of all time. This film really did feel fantastic and everything seemed metaphoric but real. After reading the reviews' page, I would say that most of what happened in the film is a metaphor on history. Obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not as is, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was how much was left to imagination, and there was only backstory for a few seconds in the beginning and middle. Overall, I really did enjoy this film, it presented the historical facts in the guise of fantasy really well.

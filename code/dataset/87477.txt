Known to theatre going enthusiasts, Les Mis has run for a successful 27 years and is still thrilling many people due, to the famous musical numbers. Tom Hooper's version will captivate the audience with an explosive cast, delivering emotional performances. The risky approach, Hooper takes with the non-stop singing performances seems to pay off, supported by gritty aesthetic and well represented costumes and settings, to transport you back in time. Jackman and Crowe complement each other with strength and bravery, portrayed through their unexpectedly impressive vocals. This is supported by Anne Hathway, the emotional stand alone feminist with her unbeatable rendition of I dream a dream. (Watch out Su-bo!) Light can be seen through this depressive era, as Sacha Bohen and Helen Bonham Carter bring a little comedy to the production, Playing the innkeepers.

Captivating and mesmerising, Hooper delivers an award winning piece, and Danny Cohen's cinematography will stun the audience. With a host of finely selected actors, who surely will be recognised at the Oscars.

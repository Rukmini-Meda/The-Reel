There is only one problem with The Matrix Trilogy, that the 1st installment was TOO good! Thats y it was followed by a horrible 2nd part followed by a more better ending. Matrix Reloaded had sky high hopes because of the 'too good' 1st installment. Reloaded was good but wasn't anywhere near my expectations. For the same reason, I expected nothing but an average ending through Revolutions but it turned out to be better than what i expected. Thats y I cud enjoy this one..This one came way above my expectations. Don't believe the IMDb ratings. This one is the better among both the sequels . Neither disappointing nor excellent, but satisfactory.

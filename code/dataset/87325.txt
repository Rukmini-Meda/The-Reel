 *This section might contain spoilers* The plot is roughly the same: a mercenary gets hired to make a coup in a far away country run by a brutal dictator, he goes there, scouts around, barely escapes then returns with a small squad and wrecks havoc. He even gets helped in both films by a girl related to the dictator. *Spoilers end here* But while in the first move there is at least a tiny grain of realism, here there is nothing but exaggeration. The mercs are superhuman who cannot be harmed and 5 of them defeats a whole army (btw don't get fooled by the cover: there won't be that many people in any mission only like 5), they are so pure hearted they don't care about the money, the main antagonist is as evil as Dr. Evil etc. And what really blew my mind was that utterly stupid plot device that - as I mentioned earlier - the mercs didn't care about the money, and wrecked the whole nation FOR ONE GIRL!!! Those damn white knights! Thet's the stupidest idea I've ever heard! As others have mentioned even the action scenes are so overly exaggerated they lack even the tiniest grain of realism thus challenging seriously your suspension of disbelief. I don't recommend watching this even for free. You won't get your 1,5 hour back! Watch Dogs of war instead! That's not a very good movie either but much better than this!

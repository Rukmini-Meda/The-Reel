Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of "familia"...no wonder it stands the test of time. The performers were at the top of their games in this one. Maybe they should make a modern- day follow up. I mean, they are remaking everything else. Why not? Need a writer? Let me know! :)

 For me, the movie was... disarming. Acting was fairly OK, but the whole action was leading me to hope for the lives of the main characters. As i watched the movie for a second time (aired on local TV) i realized that viewers (or, at least, i) aren't really supposed to care for the millions of lives lost during the destruction of whole cities - at least, as long as the plane of the main characters makes it. Of course, with the exception of the ship sinking. Those being said, i enjoyed the movie but i feel that the director should have obtained a bit more drama out of - hell - the end of the world. The matter of the dysfunctional family seamed more taken into consideration than the near extinction thing.

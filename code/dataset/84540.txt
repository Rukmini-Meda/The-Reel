Honestly, I don't know a single respectable person who doesn't like this film. It is perfect from every angle and is enormously culturally significant.

From the start when we are introduced to Don Vito, to the end where we see the conflicted Michael take control of the dark empire of his father, every scene is captured masterfully. With such a great cast including Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, with the ever masterful direction of Francis Ford Coppola, it is difficult to see this film ever failing.

Not only performance and direction-wise, it follows the book very well, too. Sure, some subplots are deleted, but with an already immense running time of 3 hours, backgrounds of minor characters like Al Neri and Rocco Lampone will be missed, but accepted as non existent.

Overall, this film is perfect.

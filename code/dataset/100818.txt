I watched the movie expecting a classic Hollywood ending, i suppose; where the good guys survive and beat the bad guys. Though the ending was different than i expected, it was far from refreshing. First of all, i didn't see the point of killing Trinity. It really gutted me to see her die, as she was my favorite character. They could have killed everyone else but Neo and Trinity and i would have been OK with it. So could anyone tell me what the Wachowski brothers might have been thinking when they killed her off? I was very disappointed by this final addition to the trilogy, and would much rather it had turned out different. From the moment Neo was blinded, dread crept into my heart and didn't leave. As the credits rolled on, i felt thoroughly depressed and amazed at the way the Wachowski brothers had decided to wrap up their amazing story. Could anyone help enlighten me on the reasons for their making it this way??

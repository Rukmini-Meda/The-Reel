 I hate to say it because I've been a fan of most of the players here, but the main thing this film did for me was show how old they were all getting to be. Don't take that as a knock, because I'm in my mid-Sixties myself and in good shape, so I can relate to how the Expendables decide to remain relevant in a rapidly changing world. Given the premise, this was bound to be pretty much an over-the-top adrenaline rush for the average fan-boy, but with actors like Willis, Schwarzenegger and Rourke in the cast, one could understandably feel cheated by their in and out appearances in the story. It also didn't surprise me that a lot of the heavy action scenes were filmed almost entirely in the dark, a testament to how impossible it would be for a half dozen guys to take out an army. Which they did as one would expect in a film like this. For me, the best scene was when Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) took out the six dudes on the basketball court. At least that was believable. Yeah right, but considering what he did for a living, maybe he could have pulled it off for real.

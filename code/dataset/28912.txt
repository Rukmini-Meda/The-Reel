 I was moved by RUSSEL CROWE'S acting,when i first watched this movie.i'm a great admirer of his acting,which shows his class,and seems a genuine character in movies like this.I like his movies with less actions,where the pivot of the movie is a character.That's why i love his movies like 'the insider' and 'L.A confidential' more than 'the gladiator. Now,i come to explain his character in this movie.A mathematician genius,who is surrounded by some jealous mates,who always try to humiliate him,but he never loses his temper except once or twice.He keeps on working with a great composure and proves his mettle. This movie is a great show of talent.It's character is powerful because of outstanding character of Crowe,which is backed by a real story.

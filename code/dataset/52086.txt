I grew up in the era of the first three and though Return of the Jedi was very flawed I love watching those first three. I was excited to see this movie. I saw it in the first few days it was out and thought it was an embarrassment on so many levels. The story, the voices, the special effects, the story, the characters, were all terrible. It had so few redeeming qualities and none that constitute mention.

It comes on TV today and I decide to give it another shot. It is worse than I remember it. It is unwatchable. I look on IMDb and see it has a decent rating, which has to be because many fans have inflated the ratings. I can only compare this movie to torture. It is sad to see the original creativity to fall to such a low level. It is so sad. It is terrible, terrible, terrible.

Just like the second movie I found parts of this hard to fallow. But it was still a good movie, and I found it to be better then the second. However, the first one of course is the best for all three of them. But this one is great. I liked the war scenes. And I liked how it ended even though Neil dies. Neil makes a deal with the robot army that if he kills the due whom I forgot the name that they would end the war with the humans. Each action scene is good. The stunts and everything are as great as they where in the firs two movies. But I wasn't as blown away in this one as I was in the second one because I though the stunts and special effects would be better then the second since this was to be the end but they were the same. However it was a good movie just not what I had expected.

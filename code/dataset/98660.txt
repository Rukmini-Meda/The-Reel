The Expendables is a fantastic movie with a good storyline and a very strong cast that know how to act in an action movie.The movie is action packed from start to finish,and some scenes are so brutal you'd want to look away from it,a very impressive job from Sylvester Stallone.The cast of the movie is incredible,Sylvester Stallone,Jason Statham,Jet Li and even Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make a cameo appearance,but I was disappointed they didn't stay longer because their characters strong personality was very promising.I would highly recommend the Expendables to all action movie fans,it won't disappoint.

Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone),a CIA operative starts a team to take down an evil dictator and an even worse CIA agent that has betrayed his country,they also must save the dictators daughter from being killed.

 That incredible piece of pure cinema from the genius director Mr. Milos Forman would never have any corrections. That man had simply shot a movie already finished in his head. And what a movie - no one has ever done - replace one phrase from the screenplay and that would be diminishment, replace one scene and the structure would fall. Mr. Forman has embodied the spirit and talent of the natural boon Mozart in this breathtaking, heart-breaking movie. It is unarguably the best motion picture ever. It is a masterful combination of acting and storytelling, of sight and sound. A work of consummate artistry and craftsmanship. My favourite movie of all time.

 I gave this movie a 10 just to bring its ratings up as a 5.7 is so unworthy of this film. It is a great movie for kids, teens and as an adult I think it is worth watching. Sure it is no great classic but defiantly better than what I see here in reviews as a lazy Sunday afternoon movie. I say it is worth a 7, not the best film I have seen but good entertainment, with a good script, good players and yes just a good watch. Not for those seeking an in-depth movie but its a 10/10 compared to the shark movies that adorn the screen these days. As I have said it is a watchable movie and when it was first released I would have pad to watch it and not felt ripped off. So watch it, make up your own mind, it's not the best in the world but if you like sci-fi then watch it.

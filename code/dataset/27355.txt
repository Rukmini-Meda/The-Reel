I don't know exactly why but I really love this movie. I am that kind of people who wants to see a movie once most of the time but with this movie, something is different. If I saw it anywhere, I can't change the channel, I always watch it through to the end again and again. The amazing visuals, the story, the whole movie is really good, I think.

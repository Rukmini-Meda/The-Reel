Despite some awful critics, I have to say that this movie was more than I expected. What most people that didn't like it criticized was that the movie left some story arcs unanswered, but this in fact was something to be praised.

The movie didn't give all the answers, but rather left the foundations for the audience to think, analyze an decide them. That's how there are so many interpretations to it, it has so many layers that it would take more than just one good chat to understand all the meanings of the matrix.

This third installment didn't have more kung fu, or philosophical speech than the first two, it rather had more symbolisms throughout not only the actions and reactions of the characters but also through the concepts used.

Something people should consider is that according to Joel Silver, Reloaded and Revolutions are the same movie cut in half, which gives a different perspective to Revolutions if only analyzed alone.

This movie is about an end, death, finding a meaning for life, fighting, truth, etc. But it is not a movie about conclusion. The answers given in Revolutions lead to more questions because in the end it is about believing rather than knowing (reading between lines that is one of the may messages of the movie). After all, if you knew everything, what would be the point?

Revolutions also has some incredible special effects scenes and sound. The lightening is superb along with all the technical aspects of the film. The CGI doesn't look as exaggerated as in Reloaded (it's better executed).

The only complain I have is that the chemistry between Neo and Trinity is a little lacking. The story arc is well resolved, but I don't know if it was a matter of the actors or the directors that the chemistry is just not felt.

In the end I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10

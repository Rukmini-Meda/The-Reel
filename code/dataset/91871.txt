The trailers for this film made me bubble with eagerness and excitement for what looked to be an excellent movie.

I don't trust trailers anymore.

What a ripoff! The special effects are murky, the acting boring, and the plot about as uneven as Nicolas Cage's recent acting record as compared to ten years ago. Now that's pretty uneven. I wanted to care when a character would get impaled on a scorpion's stinger, but I found myself incapable of feeling for characters we had no relation to or understanding of. The only reason I would ever care if some Greek dude got obliterated would be if he had a cool hairdo. Rewrite the screenplay so as to be free of campyness (to an extent of course) and give me a character that I can be sympathetic for, not some snotty demigod. Get a grip. If you have a Friday night to kill, try "Gladiator", "300", or Lord of the Rings. Skip this mess.

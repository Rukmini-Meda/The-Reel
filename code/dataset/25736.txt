 This is a old fashion action movie, so take it for what it is. It's a very good movie, especially if you consider all those action star actors working together. It has to be very hard, all those stars, who are usually working alone, to join them for one movie. And they really clicked, it was chemistry between them. I admire that, and as a action lover, i really enjoyed this movie. It's full of action, and great dialog. Story isn't complicated, so you won't be confused at any time. Like i said, old fashion action movie. Don't expect nothing else or you will be disappointed. But every action lover, will love this movie like me.

Boi, settle in, i respect people's opinion when they say the godfather is overrated but how can you hate a movie that is so well made on all level the acting is above superb everyone does a great job especially the leading men Marlon Brando is spot on with body language voice and general acting, Al Pacino seems bad at first but once he does the shooting scene it goes uphill like very uphill the shooting scene is his best where his eyes tell the whole story its like he is Micheal Corleone at that moment Robert Duvall does great load acting along with James Caan and a lot of the other male characters. The directing is so spot on in my opinion the second best directed film Coppola strives for such realism you can see it in the scene with the dead horse the actor wasn't aware that there would be a dead head in his bed and the head is real from a real horse so is scream is so authentic. The opening scene and ending scenes has so much detail and symbolism that I can't even go into details. The pacing is f.....g amazing you never get bored even thou it's 3 hours long when ever you are close they hit you with a scene that just blow up and you are fully hooked again. The script is amazing a great story and so many quotable lines the story has so many twist and turn and the characters always feel real the dialogue is spot on delivering so much suspense and information so effectively. The Score it's probably the best score of all times I have never heard a score that fits the movie so perfectly and could also work effectively as normal music it delivers so much suspense and, the best pieces are the godfather waltz (the start) and the baptism these pieces deliver suspense information are are just great I sometimes start hearing these pieces in my head because they are so good. The cinematography is also some of the best of its kind the lighting conveys so much information and every scene is framed perfectly every scene could be a painting. And that is just some of the reasons why the godfather is one of the best film of all time and not overrated (I still respect your opinions).

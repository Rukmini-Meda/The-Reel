Every year sees the release of a few epic films, which are the kind that really bring the people into the movie theatres. They delight us and take us through whole new worlds of adventure and exciting new things to see. It wasn't really until the 1970s that the summer blockbuster started. Science Fiction had always been a major event with moviegoers and in 1977 they would get the thrill of a lifetime because of a film that some felt wouldn't make it. It was followed by two sequels and that appeared to be the end, but that would change over two decades later. The release of the first installment in the new trilogy was one of the most anticipated of all time and people even camped outside movie theatres to see it opening day. This was a long time coming and had a lot of hype surrounding it, but did it deliver?

Pros: Solid performances. Beautifully scored. Incredible visual, make-up, and creature effects. Exciting pace. Mind-blowing costume and production designs. Some excellent action and fight scenes. Some fantastic new worlds and creatures. Quite well written. A lot of gorgeous scenery.

Cons: The character of Jar Jar Binks is frustrating because on one hand he's harmless and kind of cute, but is also an obvious comic relief and ends up serving little purpose beyond that. The race sequence is exciting, but far too long.

Final thoughts: Like so many others the original 'Star Wars' trilogy was a favorite during my childhood that I would watch again and again until the VHS tapes nearly wore out. That hasn't changed all these years later and this longtime fan is quite happy with this entry. The magic was not lost and the film holds up so well. For so long it looked like this would never happen, but thank goodness George Lucas didn't let this slide by.

My rating: 4.5/5

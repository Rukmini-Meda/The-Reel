I have come across a lot of mind bending, thought provoking, and even life changing movies most of which(most of) are in the IMDb top 250 but maybe I was living under a rock so I didn't come across Amadeus it was right there in the top 250..

Let me summarize my review not that I have "AMD" or something

1) This story is by no means about Mozart although we get to know his personality which is so unbecoming of. 2) I have connected with Salieri maybe he is close to becoming my idle, the patron saint of mediocrities..we all are in a sea of mediocrities aren't we. 3) All men are NOT equal in the eyes of GOD you can ask Salieri why...

What a masterpiece this is really a must watcher I was wading in the waves of emotion while watching this movie sometimes I felt sad for Salieri sometimes I wanted to destroy him sometimes I was cursing Mozart and then appreciating his genius through Salieri.

I couldn't believe Mozart could be a person like he was...Salieri was right considering God's unlikely choice(Mozart and not Himself) until he came face to face with the genius of Mozart and then he realized he can never become someone like Mozart and gave himself up to God's will..

I don't care about how much truth is there in the story I just want to love this movie forever.

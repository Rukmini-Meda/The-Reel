After watching the original three films as a kid, of course I had high expectations for this movie, but even after seeing the movie, and taking into account the faults it had, I still enjoyed the movie and appreciated it. This movie took into account what the original movies lacked. There was more action, which for the most part was great. Also, we finally get to see a closer look at some of the less known planets, some of which we had seen only a glimpse of at the end of "Return of the Jedi". There are though a couple a huge problems the movie did have, that would have put off many people who aren't big fans. One of which is how fast paced parts of the movie were, parts of the movie that I would have loved to be longer were cut short, and plenty of amazing areas are not well focused on. Another thing is that Obi-Wan plays only a small role in the movie, acting as more as Qui-Gons side kick, which for any fan would be bothersome. Also Qui-Gon is never really fully explained, and at the end, you kind of end up wishing that he was not put in, or that more was known about him to make the last major fight scene more dramatic. Overall, this movie will get any fan excited, yet annoyed at the same time, and its best just to watch this movie to continue to explore and appreciate the Star Wars Universe.

I'm glad to see Silvester Stallone in any movie, but I was wondering what happened to him after making Rambo 4. He's back with an all star cast of A list action movie actors in this movie. It's almost like Stallone's version of the Avengers. Only he would have the clout to pull something like this off.

At first when you see the list of actors, this is going to be a really exciting movie. Each of the actors are good on their own, and it's hoped that together they'd be outrageous. This doesn't happen though because the script is somewhat old fashioned. If this movie was made in the '80s, it would have been good, but in the 21st century, it's just more of the same. Sly really needs to modernize his concept of how an action movie could be. The bad guys wasn't up to par with the heros either. The Rock music, both on this and part 2 was really old fashioned.

This movie would have benefited if it borrowed some ideas from the Magnificent Seven. In that movie, each of the characters were well fleshed out, and functioned as a team, but also interesting to watch as individuals. These guys weren't interesting as a team or individuals.

Visually the movie was really good. Just for that it's worth the watch.

So a movie that could have been epic more or less ended up being just an above average movie. I think the series has lot of potential, so I hope they'd make a third installment that's totally over the top.

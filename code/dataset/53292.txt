This has to be my favorite movie of all time! I remember the first time I saw it on opening day and loved it. It's perfect: awesome action cool visuals (after all, this is the highest grossing movie ever), and Fantastic acting. This movie is, in my opinion, one of the most memorable. I highly recommend this if you are in to action movies. I really hope they make a sequel.

 I have entitled my poignant and beautiful review, "Excellent - The Stuff Dreams are Made of". This is because I like this movie, it's pretty good. I laughed, and I cried, and it moved me deeply. I've seen it a few times now, and every time I watch it, I think after I have finished and am done and all the way through, I think to myself in my head, I think, "Hmmm, that was a good one, I liked it". I say to myself this, and then I say to myself, "I'm hungry, I'm going to go make a pizza". But dear friends, do you know what I do next, every single time? I make that pizza and watch the whole three hour cinematic marvel over again. At the end, sadly, I am hungry again, and desperately want, oh so desperately need, another freakin' pizza! Oh yes, it is a vicious cycle, one that I do not know from whence or where to escape. I fear that I am trapped in this sequence of events until who knows when. Who knows? Who can save me from this seemingly hollow and purposeless existence? Who? And an even better question? Hmmm?

first of all, i would like to dedicate this to the person who wrote the'opening' review. and i would ALso like to say that i'm glad IMDb had the good sense to choose it as the opener out of all the rest of the reviews. i've almost never seen a more eloquent review here. and BOY did he NAIL it...over and over...

so. if you remember... liam neeson's character and the young obi and jar jar have just secured an underwater vessel from jar jar's people. they're cruising underwater when they are suddenly being pursued by some underwater behemoth that seemed hungry. and juuuuuuuuuuuust when it looks like they're toast... along comes this BIGGER creature to eat the chaser...(not the chasee).

at which point, liam neeson's characters says, 'there's always a bigger fish...'. these words proved to be prophetic.

again...great opening article, whoever you were...thanks. and people...? a six point five? who ARE you? WHAT? no HULK? too WHAT? did the political aspect put you to sleep? did lucas grow up and leave you all behind? WHAT did you want from this movie that it didn't have? i was STUNNED when i saw the score...i don't think it deserved the ten that i gave it. but i've always been a person who believed in fairness. and maybe it'll be what it needs to bring it up a tenthy wenthy. now i can go back to my cave.

James Cameron with his "Avatar world" is just trying to show an Utopian society and how perfectly it works, probably reflecting his simplistic political conclusions.

Peace, prosperity, equality, freedom, love, the story everyone wants to hear and believe. Karl Marx, Jesus, Jim Jones, Hugo Chavez, and many others, told the people the same beautiful story and they all failed to change the world (or the people). At least for the best... Maybe this is why they call it utopia.

Evil capitalism, evil companies, and our evil society, and it seems you have a well made Avatar story. Yeap.. This is what you basically get by that plot as a bottom line.

Yes in that film a group of evil capitalists destroyed Earth and now they want to destroy Pandora's utopia. My response to that kind of story is a LOL.

Highly recommended film for those who dream to live in the jungle.

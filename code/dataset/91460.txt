 This movie isn't worse or better than movies of this sort. No special flaws. The usual lots of fights, killings, shots, explosions, fires and car chases. Great work by the stunts. Particularly in this movie about 50% of the time is spent with these violent scenes. A team of tough mercenaries is hired by CIA in a half clandestine way to go to a Latin American Island ruled by a dictator with the complicity of a CIA deserter who also lead a huge drug trafficking business. Their mission is to kill the dictator The gang men are very muscular as usual with Sylvester Stallone which is very helpful in physical struggles they have to get involved in. A sentimental detail is introduced in this violent climate when the Stallone's character takes a liking to the dictator's daughter who is betraying her father and acts also to save her from the grab of the CIA deserter. Well a movie for you to watch if you have nothing better to do. Then you can spend some time entertained.

Where to begin. This move goes beyond asking you to suspend disbelief. It asks you to beat belief down, grind it up, stomp on it, then choke it down with vinegar. It is nothing more than a collection of never ending explosions, gratuitous special effects, punctuated with lame dialogue.

The actors must have had their doubts during the filming, they seem so mechanical and predictable. They surely knew they were trying to polish a turd of a story.

The writers did not trouble themselves with anything inconvenient like facts or real science when they created the premise or storyline of the film. They just made a bunch of stuff up that makes no sense, and blew up the world 50x over in CGI. I lost count of how many sharks were jumped in this travesty of a story. I cannot believe the writers did not go for the cliche dove with an olive branch at the end, but I suppose they were able to resist the temptation to be that predictable.

Grab a few beers before you watch this one, you are going to need them...

Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace tells the story of...... Well doesn't really have much of a story. Essentially its movie about trade dispute and the way that it is told is so convoluted that it becomes anger enduing and extremely boring.

The Phantom Menace has no redeeming quality's what so ever. The acting it horrible, you don't by the effects, the story makes zero sense, the characters unreletable, or just plan annoying, the way it was shot is off center and the C.G.I. becomes mind numbing, and the action is overdone and has no weight.

In conclusion The Phantom Menace is garbage. Even the most dye hard of fans admit it is stupid. But the worse thing about this movie is that it is unbelievably boring. But if you want to watch something much better go to this link for Mr. Pliket's review for The Phantom Menace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI&list=PL9A12F8F947849C30 And I'm giving this one a 1/10

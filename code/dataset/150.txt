The first Matrix was a pretty good movie...but not a huge revolution...and what kinds of drugs were people smoking when they thought the Brothers W had invented some kind of deep new philosophy? By Movie #3, the bloom has definitely gone from the rose. This is a clumsy action flick, a parody of the first movie. The endless stream of Agent Smiths puts me in mind of a video card performance test I ran on my computer a couple of years ago. Its really pretty darn laughable.

Is Matrix Revolutions terrible? No, not at all. Its a decent movie, diminished by not having as many "new" aspects as the earlier chapters in the series. And further diminished by the overwhelming hype some people felt compelled to give to it and its brethren.

Matrix is not some deep revelation of powerful philosophy: its a simple Sci-Fi premise with some cool action shots and fancied up wire-Fu. Without all the hype, I might have given this movie an extra point or two...

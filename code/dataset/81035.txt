Phantom Menace was the best i love the prequels... Disney wishes they could make movies like George Lucas it had such originality and so many ideas. All the characters chosen couldn't be chosen better. It made sense to the rest of the movies. Jar Jar was an amazing character i cant believe so many people dislike this character. The scenes were beautiful the story line was amazing. People should appreciate the Prequels more and appreciate George Lucas for these amazing movies. People said it was all cgi special effects but it was all real places real scenery they really need to get informed better. People who hate on it just didn't want to see something new about Star wars all they wanted was something like the old parts. For me number 1 2 and 3 were way better than 4 5 and 6.

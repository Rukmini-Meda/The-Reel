Like many others I watched Avatar as a 3d spectacle of sorts and while the 3D was indeed spectacular, I also mostly remembered it as such.

I then watched 7 years on without 3D and was very pleasantly surprised.

In my opinion it is better than any science fiction to come after it, with the exception of perhaps Interstellar.

On second watching I was mostly surprised by the emotional response I got, despite being essentially Dancing with Wolves in space, or perhaps exactly because of it, I was emotionally invested the entire film and rooting for the hero.

It is a beautiful film, also without 3D, amazing CGI, which has also not been topped in 7 years.

It's a damn shame Hollywood doesn't take more chances on original material and instead trots out episode 7 of Marvel or constant remakes.

This could be slammed quite genuinely as just a terrible, mindless action flick. That would be enough. That being said you might reasonably turn around and accuse me of being a film snob. There is a place for action movies etc.

OK. Fine. Yes there is a place for action movies. There are some great actions movies out there. Just trust me on this one - The Expendables is not one of them.

There is so much of this film that is about ego. Each of the characters (as crappy and wafer thin as those characters are) has to maintain a macho presence that is agreeable to the dreadful, should be dead, movie actor playing them.

The scene with Stallone, Arnie and Willis is cringe-worthy.

It all gets in the way of the film. What film there is. There isn't much film to get in the way of.

So you're always aware of the different dead beat stars - rather than the characters.

The dialogue is purile. The direction is awful. The stunts are actually pretty lame and for a movie that is supposed to be a vehicle for over the top explosive special effects - it is actually quite underwhelming.

If you want an enjoyable, over the top, pumped up, steroid filled action experience (and as one man once said - why not?) - you can find much better out there. This is just a terrible, terrible movie. So avoid it.

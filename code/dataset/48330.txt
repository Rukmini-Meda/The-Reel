Classic movie with classic actors in which it cannot be missed. A movie that I grew up with and your children and grandchildren will as well. Not many movies are made in this way. Some try to replicate, but it cannot be done. A timeless classic that does not go out of style. A movie that may not be for the whole family, but eventually will.

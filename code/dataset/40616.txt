I was born in 1989 so I was unfortunate to not see the original movies when they were shown in theathers but my parents showed me the original 3 and I instantly fell in love and when I found out that they were re-releasing the original 3 back in theathers I was very excited. My father who did see the original 3 in the 70s and 80s loved the movies also and as I did loved the remastered movies. He is not what I would call a star wars fan boy by any means of the word, but I consider myself a fan boy and the impact that it had on my father (average movie goer) was very successful. When The Phatom Menace came out I was excited and at the end I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED. I am very tired of people saying that Lucas is bad and should give up, that his movies are bad are you serious? As a story goes it does not reach that of the original but the story that is depicted not only in the phantom menace but in the others are extremely solid. I feel like there is a hatred for these movies for some reason and my only conclusion is that a massive amount of lord of the rings fanboys do not have anything better to do with their time than bash a saga that is way superior then them in every form of the word. I hope that they do release the other 2 prequels and the original trilogy because seeing them on the big screen is something worth paying for.

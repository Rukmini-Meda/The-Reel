the expendables 2010 is a full action movie with a dream team of all action legends.

the cast:i wont mention all of them because it will take time Stallone,jet Li,stone cold and many more guys are here they were all awesome.

the plot:CIA hires a team to eliminate a dictator and a rouge agent on an island.

i saw this with no expectations but when i found out that this was directed by Stallone himself i was surprised that it is actually good and worth watching i have seen all rocky and Rambo series films when Stallone directs he makes mistake but this is not the case here he raised the bar and improved himself.

its got action,good actors and the big man Sly Stallone himself what more you want go see it.

overall my rating for the expendables 2010 is 5/10 it could have been better but its a nice watch.

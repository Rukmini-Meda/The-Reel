 My Dad introduce me to gladiators, Hercules movies, Gods and Goddess,Godzilla and else, so call me old school, and way beyond that, and you really don't want to argue movies with me, because I'll drag you all the way back to Napoleon 1927, Metropolis, "M" or movies that you have not even seen yet! my point? Regardless, of Ralph Fiennes, doing a cartoon of Lord Voldemort, the bad acting of what's this dude name, oh yeah! Sam Worthington, and the always repetitive cockiness of Liam Neeson, the movie is good!. After being influenced by the bad reviews it took me two years to finally watched, I though this movie would suck, well today I watched on my 116 by 80 inches screen, and I was submerse, into a movie that didn't "spam" so much color in my face like Avatar did, don't misunderstand me I like Avatar, but somehow "Clash of the Titans" did a good homage to the original made in 1981, and was better crafted that transformers two or three, so from my point of view, I would watch it again! I could;d go on and on but let's leave it like that! See you after "Wrath of the Titans"

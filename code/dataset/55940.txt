Get your Millstone here.

As long as there exists, by reason of law and custom, which, in the face of a civilisation, artificially creates hells on earth, and contemplates their own destiny that is supposedly divine.

As long as the three problems of any age - the degradation of people by poverty, the ruination of people by starvation, and the denial of the earths good ground to all, then the unholy trinity unleashed by evil politicians will run amuck.

It demands by the light of all human consciences, that we all cry out against this Hell that we have created and humbly pray to the Almighty to fill the world with the rain of his love and till the soil so it will grow children of love with bright futures.

Until then we all have a millstone tied firmly around our necks and we can hear the voices of thousands mermaids softly singing

"Suffer little children to come unto me."

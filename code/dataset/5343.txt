The Wachowski Brothers returned to direct this conclusion to the trilogy as Neo(played by Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped on a train station, which is the mid-point between the real world and the Matrix. Still reeling from the revelations told him by the Architect, Neo must fulfill his destiny to end the war with their machine masters, who are mercilessly attacking Zion, creating destruction and death. Rogue agent Smith(played by Hugo Weaving) is determined to kill Neo, after gaining the powers of the Oracle, and Neo must take Trinity(played by Carrie Ann-Moss) with him to barter peace with the machines, kill Smith, and fulfill his destiny as "The One" for his mentor Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) Disappointing conclusion to the trilogy is overly reliant on bloated F/X, mind-numbing battle scenes, and a general sense of disbelief that this is how it ends? Some good ideas are lost in this hopeless mess.

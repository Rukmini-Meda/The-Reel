Recent decades have seen growing interest in movies depicting ancient and medieval (fantasy) stories - apparently due to digital revolution enabling to depict fantasy world in non-ridiculous ways. Also, Clash of the Titans has seen great popularity (= box office), in spite of plain story with "real" characters from Greek myths; well, the visual side is great, chases-battles realistic, imaginary characters merge into real background, but the messages-ideas are too blunt and moralistic, and main characters most often on screen - younger ones - are performed by not-very-special actors. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, on the other hand, could have been more visible, they are pleasant to follow even in second-grade movies.

Thus, the movie in question is just an above-average, perfunctory movie, but 1 hour 35 minutes is okay to watch it without a blah! feeling.

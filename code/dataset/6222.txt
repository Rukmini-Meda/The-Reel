Russel Crow's acting in this story about a brilliant mathematician with schizophrenia is a difficult story that was well told. The movie and the acting especially spoke to me about how anyone even smart and talented people can be born with a disease and will have to be taking things one step at a time. Also the story hits close to home for me because my grandfather who was an inventor and electrical engineer also was battling schizophrenia before he passed away. The realism that Russel Crow portrayed in the moments when he wasn't quite clear and also how he was later able to get control over his beautiful mind really was well done and shows the amount of research that he must have done for the part. Really Great! I recommend you see it if you have not seen it!

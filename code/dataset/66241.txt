 I am an electronics engineer and during the course at first I felt I had enough time to explore mathematics to its entirety, and it was proved so awfully wrong in such style by the most basic patterns and behaviours--real numbers. Disgruntled, I watched this movie and Oh, my Gosh! Mathematics makes so common and simple things so overwhelmingly profound. What more do you need to know that the fact that there is an infinity in between any two numbers! In fact, when you think of any two numbers, or any number for that matter, it is somewhere from the infinity between any other two... continuity is made discontinuous instantly. Jhon Nash is a figure who lives it. Alisha makes love infinite. Nash drowns and develops gills. Alisha swims in the sky. The Noble prize in the end is often seen as belittling most of Nash's so called Rough work, which must not be. Well, I hope it helps you understand that there is an infinity within everything, more so in what we feel. It's a lovely story. Russel and Jennifer are immaculate and almost seem like living it all through. The part I can't keep from mentioning is how story-writer made their romance look so perfect; it often isn't this perfect for mathematicians because their expressions are just different.

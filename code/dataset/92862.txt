I think upsetting is less than awful. If I could give less than 1, I would. I went to the theater to watch this movie back in '99. So many people I have/had respect for said the movie was atrocosious, but I didn't believe anyone could do harm to the franchise. I believed the haters went in expecting to be blown away and because they didn't leave the theater with that euphoric feeling they had after episodes 4,5 and 6 a void was created and then was filled with anger. Because of this furious uproar I received from my associates, I innocently bought my ticket with low expectations. I definitely should've left feeling I got the upperhand on the matinee fee I paid.

My low expectations weren't even close to met . Menace was the first and only movie I have ever walked out. Everything was upsetting. Character development was terrible. The revelation about Midi-chlorian was mind numbing. Obviously, Jar Jar was more corrosive than alien blood. Young Anakin, well, I blame the writing for his destructiveness. The parts of the movie that should've portrayed the ominous of the dark side looked like a cheese pizza with extra cheese hold the crust and sauce.

I went into this movie thinking that if it was actually bad, then those whom produced it tried to make it bad. A theory that can never be proved but probably should be delved deeply into.

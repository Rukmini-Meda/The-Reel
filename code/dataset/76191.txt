Louis Leterrier's rebooted version of the 1981 cult film 'Clash of the Titans' is one dimensional, inconsistently acted and it's story plods along in comparison to an enormous boulder attached to the end of a truck via a rope, travelling across a rickety road.

On the other hand, for the majority of average citizens, 'Clash of the Titans' is cemented full of stunning CGI imagery and cinematography. The action sequences are on a rapid convener belt which is continuous throughout the duration and there is little time to breath.

As you may have guessed from the above, 'Clash of the Titans' has many positives which are balanced out with an equal amount of negatives. The budget of $125 million certainly polishes the films visual content which cannot be faulted. Nor can the well cast Sam Worthington, Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson who are each solid in their respected roles. However, there is too much of a video-game feel to the film with a paper thin plot, an action overload and a lack of characterisation.

When Perseus (Worthington) realises he is a demi-god, son of Greek God Zeus (Liam Neeson), he is called upon to protect Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from Hades' (Fiennes) monstrous Kraken.

Following on from the brief synopsis above is an onslaught of action scenarios involving huge, desert scorpions and more of Hades' devastating creatures.

To conclude, 'Clash of the Titans' should fill the gap left on a Friday night/weekend night though I wouldn't expect much more than a dumb but reasonably fun 106 minutes.

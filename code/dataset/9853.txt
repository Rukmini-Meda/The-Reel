I have never minded being in the minority, so I'll just come out and say it: The Matrix Revolutions is an ending worthy of the Wachowskis' groundbreaking trilogy.

The key to understanding the Matrix films is to unpeel the onion; reveal the layers. I believe that you have to understand The Matrix before you watch Reloaded, and you have to understand (as best you can) Reloaded before watching Revolutions. Those who dismissed Reloaded after a cursory glance will certainly not be able to grasp the significance of the Revolutions.

That said, it is certainly not a perfect film. Its weakest point is in the action rising toward the climax. There is a time, during the great battle, when we lose track of the hero's personal conflict. The epic battle between man and machine is extraordinary, and unlike certain scenes in Reloaded, it didn't seem to be about showing off, but there is a time where we lose the momentum of the protagonist's journey. Of course, it all ties together in the end, but when the audience has to work to connect the two plot threads, it weakens the payoff.

The other problem that stood out was the introduction of "Red Shirt" characters in this film. (Fans of Star Trek know what I'm referring to.) These are the characters that are introduced for the sole purpose of performing an important action and then dying. However, I can't really fault the Wachowskis for this, because no one has ever figured out how to handle these characters.

Ultimately, the Matrix Revolutions answers many of the questions the first two films raised, but fortunately, not all of them. It leaves some issues open for discussion, which shows that it's still possible to make a film in Hollywood without using a "Hollywood Ending."

Bottom line.....watch Reloaded again, and then go see Revolutions!

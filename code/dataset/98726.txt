 I only gave this piece of garbage 2 stars instead of 1 because of the Medusa fight scene, but one fight scene does not a movie make. I should have known better after the good reviews were mostly from people who could barely write or spell, even passably, and couldn't use the spellcheck provided right HERE in this review window lol. MY excuse is that I was visiting relatives and they didn't have much I wanted to see. This is just a terrible Hollywood blockbuster designed to separate pre-teens, teens, and young adults from their cash. This POS movie had a sinful budget of $125mil with a $65mil opening weekend (US). That is just totally sad and the only redeeming thing about it is that it provided a ton of jobs, esp in places like Ethiopia. I have no respect for the big names in this. If they still have to work at all at this point, well, something is terribly wrong. Needless to say, there is NO real character development, acting phoned in, a totally embarrassing script, and only average CG (saw the DVD on a laptop, so worse on big screen). If you are thinking of watching this, don't. Go watch Thor again, Marvel has it all over Warner's in this dept. Only good thing about this movie was that I was able to sleep through most of it, only going back to skim and see if anything worth watching developed (it didn't); if I had been totally conscious, it would have been turned off after a half hour, at MOST.

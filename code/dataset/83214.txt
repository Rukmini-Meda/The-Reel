 Admittingly, while I enjoy some musicals, Les Mis was more operatic and lost me early. That being said, the cinematic story is rich, if not dark, and thankfully allowed some room for humor. The performances were a mixed bag, but I bought into the Hugh Jackman experience while I found Russell Crowe to be a but flat. Again, the story being completely told through non-song singing took too much energy to follow. If this were in French with sub-titles I could possible be raving about it. It is a Frenck story, no? I'll watch it again down the line, but no rush. I mentioned my disappointment to my on-line community and those who saw it live were shocked, but many who, like me, were DVD only viewers, the experience did not "take me away". This is a sad tale told through non-stop singing. If that sound good to you, then enjoy!

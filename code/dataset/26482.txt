The Expendables is an exciting 80s throwback action film. It features a stellar cast of some of the hottest names in showbiz (from that era) and provides a dollop of on-screen chemistry between the main players.

Perhaps the best part of the movie is the opening scene where Somali pirates and the Expendables face off against one another. For all its shortcomings though - critics have found many - this film is a fitting tribute to the genius of rags to riches star, Sylvester Stallone.

The Expendables delivers on its promise of big action, big stars and big explosions - period. Even the violence in the flick resonates with an air of comedy - such is the nature of the movie. Stallone truly deserves a $100 million blockbuster as a tribute to his four decades of hard work as one of Hollywood's A-list actors.

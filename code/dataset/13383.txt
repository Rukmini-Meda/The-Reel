 Did you hear that? That was me sighing, the trailer certainly gave the impression this was going to be something special and that they had nailed the fantasy action target. Unfortunately they haven't.. It's a film that isn't as good as the sum of its parts, no wait a minute, that's wrong, even the parts aren't that good. A series of loose encounters that seem under played and under worked leaving you with a feeling that it's all style and no substance. From the moment the rating was unveiled it was clear that they were going to pull all their punches to allow as wider audience as possible to see this mess. A tighter, leaner more adult approach would have benefited this film no end, instead we get superfluous, ridiculous looking characters that come and go without any real purpose. Where is the suspense? Where is the tension? Where are the darker elements the story aspires to? You don't get any of these elements. As an example, they have to kill the infamous mythological creature Medusa and there is no sense of fear or tension. And that counts for practically all the enemies in the film accept, perhaps, the giant scorpions. Anyway, enough is enough, a disappointment, a missed opportunity and not a very good film. If you've got a taste for mythology try the original 1981 film instead.

This movie was a great experience. A guy who is a math genius, all his concerns is about knowledge and scientific thinking, and to be a great scientist. He forgot the part of being a human which is dealing with people not only with equations. His personality could be affected by the way that his family raised him they may not encourage him to socialize, they didn't build his personality correctly or his parents died when he was young so that affected him badly.

During university life his problem become more complicated his mind started to fill the missing part of his life by making a close friend that is not exist. Then after graduation when he didn't get the attention that he was expected to his scientific talent, he made out that important role. After getting married and his psychological problem was discovered I think the psychiatry treatment had a negative and a positive effect on him. The positive part of it is that now he knew that he has a problem, because if his wife told him that he had a problem he may not be able to believe her. But the negative part is that psychiatry treatment makes the patient feel that he is "psycho" no one would like to be attacked all the time. The atmosphere in the hospital was not helping him to be fine he got an aggressive medical treatment.

I think that the psychological treatment is a very good way in dealing with those kinds of cases, because it helps the patients to be able to take decisions, to be engaged with others and to find the solution to the problem that they have.I think that what helped him most is the psychological treatment, because he felt that his wife love him and she encouraged him, so he tried his best to be better. Also the role of his friends was very important, because he started to fill the friends "social" part and the part of practicing science again. Finally his wife is the key for his success, because she made the other half of his heart that was missing back to him.

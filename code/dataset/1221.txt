 I found this movie quite enjoyable. It's not one of those kinds of movies I would view again,however is worth watching the once. I think this movie is inspirational and empathetic to those of us who may be perceived or actually experience psychological conditions similar to that of the lead character. It shows the progress and changes made in both scientific and the social understandings, while also reveling the emotional impact this can have on those close to us. The performance of the lead characters was generally good and the story line quite clever. I love a film with a good ending, whether this be happy or sad. This film had a good ending.

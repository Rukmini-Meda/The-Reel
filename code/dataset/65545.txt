This movie was a complete shocker. The acting was so bad I could not stay with it. When acting is terrible it is tough to stay "in the movie". They really should have cast some more accomplished actors. The scenery was so terrible. It was just too fake and plastic looking for me to settle in and enjoy it.

The aspect that really got me was the predictable and boring story-line. It was so predictable that I considered switching it off numerous times. The only reason I watched the entire movie is because of the hype that it generated at the box office. Boring!

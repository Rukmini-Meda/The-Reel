Why would any actor perform to the best of their amazing abilities in a fabulous, moving movie just to then perform in mainly mediocre movies later on then retire from the world stage? Ending on a good note is good for a mediocre actor (cue Kristen Stewart, Please!!!) but I felt that Tom Hulce had so much more to give.

With Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) giving us the prologue, the story is based on Salieri's jealousy and envy for Mozart. Mozart (Tom Hulce) is about to compose a piece at a palace in Vienna (Home of the musicians). Whilst eager to meet Mozart, expecting him to be a talented, humble and grateful young man, discovers that he is actually a lewd, immature deviant. After witnessing Mozart perform, then seeing him memorise an entire piece of Salieri's music almost instantly then play it to him, he grows jealous of Mozart as he realises that god has chosen a simple, undeserving boy rather than a devout, dedicated religious musician (himself) to be bestowed with such talent. Salieri then devises a plan to get Mozart to write an absolutely perfect piece of music, his requiem mass, then dispose of Mozart and take the credit for it. He would finally gain his victory over Mozart as he will dispose of him and god as he must now watch Salieri get the recognition he finally deserves. Only time will tell if it will work...

There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. Coming from me, thats a rarity (check out my other reviews, I'm not kidding I always find something negative apart from AC3). Every actor is brilliant and as I mentioned Tom Hulce is amazing and I can't understand why he retired so soon. In short this movie is well worth seeing time and time again. I love this movie purely for the beauty and musical passion that goes into every scene.

Amadeus will always be renowned as a classic and I am telling you to see it to truly appreciate it's amazement. I place this movie at number 4 of my personal top 20 movies.

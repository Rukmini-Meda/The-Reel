Before watching this film I'd heard some fairly negative reviews but tried to view it with an open mind and must say it was better than I had expected. The story was pretty silly; I have no idea what the Kraken, a creature of Norse mythology was doing here amongst the gods of Greek Myth for a start! The story follows Perseus, a demigod who was found by a fisherman as a baby. When this stepfather is killed by Hades Perseus agrees to help the king after Hades threatens that he will set the Kraken on the city if his daughter isn't sacrificed. In order to defeat the Kraken Perseus and the soldiers assisting him must consult a group of witches and fight against several enemies including giant scorpions and the snake-haired Medusa who will turn any man who gazes upon her into stone.

If you can suspend your disbelief this film is fairly entertaining and as the action is fairly constant that isn't too hard. The special effects were impressive; in some cases if one didn't know better one might think some of the mythical creatures were real at least that was the case when watching on a fairly small television. The acting wasn't bad with Sam Worthington being a decent lead in the role of Perseus the biggest disappointment was with the late Pete Poselthwaite not because he was bad but because his character only lasted for ten minutes I was hoping to see more of this fine actor. I'm not sure that I'd go out of my way to watch this but it is worth watching if it is on television or if somebody lends you the DVD.

The Godfather in my opinion is one of the best and well produced movie I've seen. I've seen it many times and it always feel like it's the first time watching. It's an excellent film to watch by yourself or with friends (movie night). You're certainly in for a treat if it's going to be your first time watching The Godfather. It's long and I suggest turning your phone off. It's just shy of 3 hours, but it's so good that it will feel like 10 minutes.

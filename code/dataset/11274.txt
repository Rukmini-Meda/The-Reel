Far and away the best musical movie ever. And when compared to most films... it's still spectacular.

The directing, especially in the first number, is absolutely brilliant. One of the greatest camera angles in film history is when the people in the lines face away from you and you can see the front of the crooked ship.

The writing is great in both the music and the dialogue. The little boy is written perfectly, as is Jean Valjean's final alive scene. In addition, though this isn't credited to the film, the songs are great, especially "Look Down" and "I Dreamed a Dream."

The acting is absolutely fantastic. With Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne in the same movie, that can be expected. Of course, Anne Hathaway's acting in "I Dreamed a Dream" is clearly the best in the movie, and she won a well deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for it.

A truly spectacular movie.

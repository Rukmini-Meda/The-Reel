 "A beautiful mind" couldn't been better film then it already is, I can't say nothing bad about the movie. In short, the movie is about dealing with mental illness with emotion. The Plot of the movie is very interesting, touching. Great as a Biographic film, Great as a Thriler film, and also as a Romance film. A beautiful mind is very different than most of the films in the genre- psychological thriller (for example - "The silence of the lambs" , "Black Swan") mainly because of the use of emotional to solve the mental problem and find a solution for the illness. The Direction in the movie is extremely professional, Ron Howard definitely made his best work in the film, he pays attention to the small details. The screenplay is even better than the direction, clever and very original. The Acting in the movie is absolutely great! Russel Crow in the performance of his life time, In the Academy Awards history, in my opinion, the biggest mistake was giving Danzel Washington Oscar instead for Russel Crowe who gives an amazing performance as John Nash. Jennifer Connelly also very good, her best performance ever.

Well... if I had to choose the ultimate Gangsta movie to review this tops the list! Action..Crime..Suspense to name a few are all included in this flick, and it does not disappoint. This is your go-to movie when you want to feel like the ultimate CRIME BOSS (minus the jail time)Definitely one of Francis Ford Coppola best films. He really captures the essence of the lifestyle these Good fellas have. In retrospect he breathes life into the characters that already hold enough personality for an entire football team. If I had to rate it between one and ten I would say a seven, only because the movie is so damn dark you feel like the director shot the entire flick at night!

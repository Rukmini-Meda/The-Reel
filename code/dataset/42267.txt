This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....

This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.

Coming out of an experience of schizophrenia close up by relatives, there is a sense in this movie that just shows the encounters of the "abstract ghosts" in a marvellous way. The haunting emotions, the fear, the anxiety, the terror... and the complex warmth from the people around John Nash. Fantastic! Can there be an understanding coming out from that "genius and bright minds" goes too far in an complex pattern inside the human so that it creates an imaginary world out of "an fake habit"....?

Russel Crowe shows his best sides in acting and should have been given a double Academy Award for his work in this motion picture. Absolutely phenomenal! Christopher Plummer..... Ed Harris.... Jennifer Connelly.... they all make this actors guild a perfect match.

Can a soul be schizophrenic.... or is it "only" the brain? A stunning piece of art. Gives so much to the viewer, that lets it.

Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great work speaking of the zeitgeist. - The actors : Oscar nominations. Question on that one? - The story : Wonderful! A man change so much with mathematics. Thank You, John Nash. - Entertainment : Spellbinding. - Age : Maybe from 7 years old, taking the consideration of the scenes of weapons and also the mental asylum.

8,1 out of 10. (The final rate is based based most from my entertainment of the movie.)

(Short elucidation for the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)

 could not agree more with the review posted by "Michael Bay look like Bergman". An absolute blast from the past (depends on ur age though,mine is 37 so it certainly does hold true).Like the proverbial "put your feet up", get a chilled pack of your favorite drink,a big cheeseburger,crank up the receiver a wee bit than usual (never mind the neighbors,they usually come without a sense of occasion). And what you have is the stage all set to blow you away.And when it ends this movie makes you say wow, that was something. All this good quality time spent watching jason and sly put in a stellar show at the price less than that of any made in china stuff u get at Walmart.Awesome movie and i still go on and revisit some of the scenes,its that kind of movie.

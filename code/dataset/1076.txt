Spoiler Alert This third edition of the Matrix series was just as great as the other with the visual and audio effects, but the ending was a let down. Even though you could see it, coming from the point that Neo has his little accident with the power cable. All though the end was bad, it does leave a little gap for another sequel, and another chance to end it right.

As far as my feelings overall, it reminds me too much of Star Wars: Episode I. Think about it. We find a female in trouble. (Queen Amidalia and the Oracle) Next, we meet stupid people. (Jar-jar and the little girl who is the last exile. What a coincidence) Then the warriors go to fight evil. (Qui-gon & Obi-wan and Neo & Trinity) After a lot of mixed other stuff, we arrive at two final battles, one with armies and one with main characters. (Q-g & O-w meet Darth Maul and Neo & Tri. meet Smith.) Both movies have good fights, but then everyone dies. (Obi-wan dies just a little later than the others do) After all that, we are told that we should look to the future for hope. (Let us not forget the idea that we have to make a choice to do so.) The only thing that is different is that Star Wars jumps from battle to battle every few minutes and Matrix waits until one is done and then switches.

Overall, I do think that the movie is okay. The effects do out-weigh the plot in this one, just because the other two Matrix movies back it up. I would give it a 7.5 out of ten if I could, but they do not allow half points.

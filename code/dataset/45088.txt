The Matrix: Revolutions (2003): Dir: Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett: Weakest of the Matrix trilogy about man's battle against machines. This was better established in The Terminator. Picking up where Reloaded left off, Neo awakens in a subway station where he is trapped outside the matrix and the train refuses his entry. Meanwhile Trinity, Morpheus and others set to rescue him while continuing the war against the machine army. Once Neo is rescued the screenplays descends into constant action, blazing violence and special effects that seem to go on and on. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski who provide us with superb visual spectacle that is rushed to release too soon. Worse than the previous sequel with a disappointing ending just to add to insult. Keanu Reeves returns again as Neo with Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Their introduction is well established until it becomes constant bang bang and the low blow ending. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is reduced to a cardboard performance. Hugo Weaving as agent Smith throws out lines fit for a Saturday Night Live comedian. Jada Pinkett is also underused to the point of just showing up because she wasn't lucky enough to be in the original. Any spiritual parallels take a backseat to production values. Score: 3 / 10

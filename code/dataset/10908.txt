 There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. The almost total non involvement with the characters, the fact that the constant disasters shown are transparently models or CGI so who cares if they are destroyed, the horrible music score, the casting of an ever more annoying John Cusack in the lead, the fact that many good actors are forced to appear in this kind of slop just to keep working. On top of all that it is way too long. The film makers have obviously forgotten the basic tenants of this kind of film, to have people you care about be front and center and have the jeopardy be something the audience can relate to at least abstractly. If your in the mood for a disaster epic watch The Towering Inferno or the original Poseidon Adventure instead!!

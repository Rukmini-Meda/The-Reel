Mike Stoklasa of Redlettermedia did his definitive 90 minute Plinkett review of Phantom Menace. A legion of enraged fanboys have expressed their vitriol in endless nitpick critiques. Mainstream media critics heaped praise on the film and then sheepishly backtracked over time. What else is left to say?

The tiresome political intrigue, the bland story, the pointless side characters, Jar Jar, mediocre bluescreen effects, its all been said before. I don't disagree with the sentiments of other reviews. In fact the more times I watched it, the worse the film seemed to get.

The final three way fight between Qui Gon, Obi Wan and Darth Maul is the only reason to sit through the film, but even that is ruined by constantly cutting away to infantile slapstick of Jar Jar arsing about on the battlefield and uninspired battle antics and accidental victories.

Positives? John Williams' fantastic score gives momentum to an otherwise moribund film, Liam Neeson is dependably good and Ian McDiarmid is one of the few actors capable of chewing through Lucas's turgid dialogue and remain respected.

There's a reason I haven't sat through this film all the way for more than 10 years: it's a boring turd.

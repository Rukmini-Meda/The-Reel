I noticed all the criticism on IMDb on Avatar and also Gravity.

Reading the reviews and posts of these people I get the strong feeling these are mostly people who never saw these movies in 3d in the theater but are basing their opinion on seeing the movie at home in 2d.

Avatar and Gravity were both made to be a visual 3d experience and that is what they excel at, how they should be seen and how they should be rated. No, they do not have amazing stories, but that was never the idea behind these movies. So to criticize them only because you have not seen the movie the way it was intended is unfair in my opinion.

Take my advice. Go see these movies in 3d, and if possible on a large screen and most of you will no doubt change their minds as it are mind blowing experiences that way.

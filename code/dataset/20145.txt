The best movie of all time. Excellent acting and directing. When I first watch this movie I couldn't watch any other movie for long time, because all of others were crap. I can watch it for 100 times, but I will watch it for 101 time. People who doesn't like action movies, crime or mafia would love this movie, too. Just need to write this and tell everyone to watch this masterpiece.

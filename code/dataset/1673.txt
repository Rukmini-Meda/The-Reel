This was not at all the right film for me because I love listening to beautiful singing and this was the exact opposite. Tom Hooper is a very capable director but getting untrained voices to handle this score was a total mistake. It is constantly painful to hear them simply barking out the lines, and it's not helped by the fact that the lines themselves are so thoroughly banal. The excellent acting, detailed recreation of 19th c. France and brooding drama of Hugo's great tale do not succeed in overcoming the agony of the so-called singing, which ruined some fine songs (though in truth there are not that many). For me hell would be having to sit through endless films in which Helena Bonham-Carter does her 'get me, I'm a little slut' act. Ugh

By the way, never was there a revolution with so many well fed, good looking insurgents.

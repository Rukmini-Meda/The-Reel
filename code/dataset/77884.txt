We watched this movie in music class during our unit on composers. Not only is it historically inaccurate it is not interesting. The plot could have condensed to 30 minutes but instead it stretches on for 3 hours. I and most of my classmates were over it by the second class.Instead of this I recommend watching an actual documentary about Mozart which will be much more entertaining and informative. 4 out of 10 stars

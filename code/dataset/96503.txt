Really excellent movie. For those that are '80s action film fans and '90s fans, you will love this. Sure, Arnold Schwarzenegger only make a brief cameo.. and I mean really brief. He is in one scene, says a few lines, and leaves and doesn't agree to go on a mission. There's all your favorite action stars that you've grown to love.

What's more to say about the plot? The Expendables are a team hired to do the dirty work, and they are hired to overthrow an entire Latin American nation being influenced by an American millionaire. Barney Ross and Christmas go on alone, and realize it's too much, but before they leave, they set off some huge fireworks. By fireworks, I mean explosions. They return for one reason, a girl. A girl that refused to leave the country even with all the chaos.

It's an action film with several scenes of heartwarming stories. Very brief, this movie is almost entirely action and that's what you've always liked about Sylvester Stallone. In his 60's and still rocking it. Have fun.

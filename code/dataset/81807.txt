It's been years since I watched this movie and I forgot just how spectacular it is. There are few films that leave you pondering at the end, just taking in what you've seen after the credits roll.

The direction, the acting, the sets, costumes, all fabulous and larger than life. And of course, the music, oh the heavenly music! Utterly captivated throughout the entire film, watching F. Murray's Abraham's portrayal of Antonio Salieri was quite simply, beautiful as it was cruel. You felt his pain, his anguish, he despised and revered Mozart as he despised and revered God for his predicament. Watching Salieri battle his own personal demons, his sincere longing to be known as a great composer, his frustration at his mediocrity and honest recognition of it, yet whilst he loathed Mozart, he loved him, rather was in complete awe of him and was the only one who truly understood the sheer magnificence of his work.

The scene where he picks up Mozart's work, seeing the realization on his face as each time he delves deeper it becomes ever more apparent what a genius Mozart was, no corrections, no revisions, 'as if he had just written was what dictated.' The direction, hearing the music piece by piece as it is composed, I felt like Salieri, a mediocrity witnessing the sublime, heavenly talent of an evolving prodigy.

There are few films that leave such an impression on you, this movie was a journey, an education, I gained a new found appreciation for classical music that I never had before because I was too naive.

This masterpiece was breathtaking.

Truly awful film, with uninspired action, and acting from most of the cast which is just as bad.

There are certainly lots of explosions and guns, but sadly the screenplay - which could have been described as one big cliche if it had made enough sense to gain even that distinction - is truly rotten.

Even as a brainless action film it fails, due to uninspired fight scenes and hyper-frenetic editing, which leaves you with little clue of exactly what is going on a lot of the time.

It also includes the most unexplained, senseless, and unbelievable forgiveness of a character which I can remember seeing.

Written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, he unintentionally proves himself a relic of the sort of all brawn, no brains, chauvinistic films which would be better left in the past.

I was cajoled into writing this review by the numerous unjust critiques of this movie. People these days expect a lot of complexity in the script, in editing, camera handling and the whole movie-making process. Even when simplicity has vastly greater effect. While the story might seem cliched, I think the idea was beautifully executed and the message conveyed was clear. Imagine a confluence of both physical and metaphysical aspects of nature, of spiritual and material life, of politics and imperialism; I think the movie couldn't have been more profound and so legible that even kids could comprehend. And as you delve, you realize just why Cameron is one of the greatest directors of all time. This is what dreams are like, not those from Inception.

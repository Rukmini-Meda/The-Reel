I've noticed that most of the reviews panning this movie seem to be more about complaining about the 3D effects. News flash people; the greedy studio heads decided to convert this movie to 3D at the last possible minute. Therefore the 3D effects look like crap because not only was it rushed, but it wasn't filmed in 3D!!! So if it was that bad why the hell would you sit through the entire movie then write a review on how bad the movie was? Go get your money back and watch it in 2D! As for the movie itself; I had only seen the original about a week before seeing the remake. While I enjoyed some elements of the original, I thought it was lacking in terms of pace. This film, definitely improves on the pace, and you get to care a bit more the rest of the soldiers that followed Perseus into the underworld. My main complaint is that they added a new female character to the plot, and as much as I enjoy seeing Gemma Aterton, it pushed away focus from Andromeda. Who really was crucial to the plot. So here we are caring for Io, and not really seeing enough of Andromeda to really be concerned for her. Yet the whole plot is about saving her more or less.

Bottom line, great action/adventure movie. Doesn't really follow Greek mythology so don't let that shock you. Could have used a bit more character development but most action movies could. I give it 8/10.

In order to prevent the Kraken from destroying the city of Argos, Perseus, son of Zeus, travels to the other side of the River Styx where he must slay Medusa the Gorgon.

I'm a big fan of mythological fantasy films, but found the the original Clash of the Titans to be a huge disappointment: the numerous big name Hollywood stars were unable to do much with the lousy script, the special effects were amongst the legendary Ray Harryhausen's least impressive work, and lead Harry Hamlin was out-acted by a mechanical owl.

This recent remake features stunning, state of the art CGI special effects and an equally star-studded cast, but little effort seems to have gone into improving the script, which is just as pompous and dull as before; furthermore, in Sam Worthington they have somehow managed to find a pretty-boy actor every bit as wooden as Hamlin which in itself is a feat almost as impressive as slaying a Kraken!

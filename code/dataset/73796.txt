 Going into watching this film you just simply must know what you were getting into an action film with one liners. This film has almost everybody in it but the main two are director Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham as the main members of the all star group The expendables who set out to take out a dictator and liberate a nation. The performances are what you would expect and great for this film every single one of them, also some awesome cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who I hope to see both in the sequel more. The action is fantastic throughout but the last action scene oh my goodness is some of the best action there is ever and is clearly the best part of the film as expected. Dolph ludgren as the crazed ex member of the team was a cool dynamic also stone cold Steve Austin is great in action and Eric Roberts is an awesome villain like he always is. However, for a mindless action film there is some slow parts which I could have done without. Also I would have liked the characters of jet li, randy cetoure and terry crews to be expanded more instead. But this is an awesome film filled with everything you would expect.

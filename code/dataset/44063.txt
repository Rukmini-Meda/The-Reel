It shocks me to see this so low on the rankings (well 88 top films of IMDb). This movie is damn near perfection. If you haven't seen it, do it now. If you teach in film school, show it. If you have loved ones, show them.

Just watch this movie.

The art direction is superb, the acting is phenomenal, Tom Hulce's laugh is delightful. There is so much to love, and so much to take it.

I highly recommend clearing your day and your mind because it requires both, especially if you watch the Directors Cut which is masterful.

F. Murray Abraham is an absolute delight, and deserves all the praise he received for the film. And much like the Salari and Mozart, its ironic but not unjustified that Abraham and Hulce went head to head for the leading role Oscar.

If only both of them could win.

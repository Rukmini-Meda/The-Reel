 I don't remember when I found out about Les Miserables was being made into a film but I recall being fairly excited. I was just coming into the world of musicals and this would be one of the first I properly became invested in. Upon watching the film I found it quite upsetting (which was to be expected, of course), though I'm sure the proper term is uplifting as we do know the outcome of the French Revolution. The acting on Jackman's part was acceptable and carried the film throughout the plot, as well as his impeccable singing which by all measures made him a perfect casting choice. After its release many people criticised Crowe's singing voice however I feel that his portrayal of the morally tormented police inspector far outweighed the sour notes he may have displayed. By far the most enjoyable part of the film was the relationship between Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen's characters, the Thenardiers who lightened the mood on the mostly saddened tone the film expresses. When it comes to criticisms I have for the film I have two main worries, one of which is Amanda Seyfried who (based partly on my views on her due to previous movies) failed, I believe, to match the standard the rest of the ensemble managed to uphold. This, unfortunately, left a rather distressing amount of emotional aspects unexplored. The other concern I hold for the film is its reliance on the singing-on-set technique which, I'm sure, encouraged many of it's viewers to witness. This left the film without any other unique strategies and made it lose heart when the film- making is considered. However, Redmayne, Barks and Tveit shone throughout the piece and pulled the slightly disjointed plot into an amalgamation of emotion, drama and song.

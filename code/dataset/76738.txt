The matrix and its concepts are actually based on the Concepts in Bhagvad Gita. Its a religious concept of the Hindus( in India).

Bhagvad gita is a book containing principles of life.If you can read the English translation of the book.......you will find the similarities.

Even the diologue's has been directly taken from the book. Wachowski brothers have tried hard to make it look real.They tried hard to adapt it into the world of super computers and robots. Even though the movie is well made. Its not right for the Directors to Take the credit. The movie is inspired by the Hindu book.

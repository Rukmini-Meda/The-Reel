 I own the DVD of this movie and have watched it more than once. It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the true story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. Vivien Cardone, whose age was only in the single-digit column when the movie was produced, was outstanding as the little girl Marcee Herman who was taken with him; the character Marcee herself was a phantasm. Paul Bettany was excellent as the practically-vicious Charles, Nash's roommate; Charles himself was a phantasm. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as Nash's shock treatment and his cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. It was another great feat for producer Ron Howard, and, of course, for Universal, Dreamworks, and Imagine Productions. Intriguing in its own right, I'm glad I saw it.

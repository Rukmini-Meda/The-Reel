 This film was nothing more than a glorified video game. I don't know about you, but my brain disengages when all that Computer Generated Imagery is used. This film relied on it. Also, the 3-D effects were pitiful. Liam Neeson's face seemed to project outward from his head. Persius was updated so he can be "cool" circa 2011. In a world full of guys with long hair and beards, our hero walked around in a buzz-cut and a gangsta attitude.. Why not just throw in the saggy pants and tattoos while you're at it? The dialogue was extremely bad. Everything was some kind of reverent, lofty quote; as if everyone was a Shakespeare. The giant scorpions and flying harpies were CGI nightmares....more fake than the old stop-action creatures. Medussa was just a CGI joke - shrouded in shadowy, jerky-action. The Cracken was scary looking and huge, but ultimately not that menacing. It seemed like a monster with a disability of some kind. All the action sequences were of the confusing CGI fast- paced, nonsensical variety - people rubbing up on each other, falling 60 feet, getting up like nothing happened, etc. And the whole thing was filmed in a kind of amber hue that sucked out any color. Don't see this mess if you can help it.

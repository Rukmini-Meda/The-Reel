This film is a masterpiece. I love it. The magnificent dialogue, the wonderful acting by Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best...It's so dense; every single frame has so much going on... Sure, George Lucas may have gone too far in some places, but it was stylistically designed to be that way, and he did diminish the effects a lot. This movie is the best movie since Cop Dog. Of course it's not as good as Titanic, but how could Lucas beat Titanic??? It's impossible. Also, I sure as hell live the scene where Jar Mar steps on the poop. That's a great scene. The only complaint I have with this movie is the lack of Jar Jar scenes. He's the best character in the film. Watch it now, you Hack Frauds.

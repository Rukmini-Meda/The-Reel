If you can look well-beyond this bio-film's exaggerated sentimentality, its "schizophrenia" whitewashing, and the fact that its story was only very loosely based on the real-life genius/mathematician, John Nash, then, yes, you just might find it's worth sitting all the way through its 135-minute running time (which did, indeed, wear on this viewer's patience more than once).

From my perspective - A Beautiful Mind seemed to be more interested in spotlighting Nash's mental illness (and his imaginary friends/alter egos) than it did about concentrating on his amazing ability to crunch all of those numbers.

As well - The focus on Nash's relationship with Alicia Larde (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Connelly), who eventually became his wife, certainly had a tendency to become an irksome "soap opera" bore, which grated on my nerves, often enough.

A Beautiful Mind covers approximately 40 years of Nash's life, from the 1950s to the 1990s, when he was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Nash is still alive today.

Anyways - Regardless of my beefs and believing that this film has really been so over-rated, I still give it a 6-star rating.

*Note* - If you have the time - I suggest you Google images of John Nash just to see how his looks compare to those of Russell Crowe's, the actor who portrayed him in this film - And prepare yourself for something of a mild shock-eroo!

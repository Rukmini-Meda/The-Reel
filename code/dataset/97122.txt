On my desktop, the background picture is of a black, hard-plastic-and-metal Ma Bell desk phone, the kind we analogs grew up with (unless there was a "Trimline" in the house). The dial flummoxes the kids in my classroom. It's so . . . slow! I tell them that the glory of that slow dial is that you could change your mind about asking out the girl (in order to avoid embarrassment when she OBVIOUSLY says no) and she would never know it was you calling because there was no caller I.D.

But, it's so slow!

Oh, shut up and do your work.

What, you ask, has this to do with the remake of Clash of the Titans?

You figure it out.

The 3D animation was great. Visually a stunning piece of cinematography. However, the story of a tribe that is endangered and fights to protect its environment and habitat is so old and beaten. I got no sense of who the characters are. The storyline is so thin, it is almost invisible. I also did not like how the animated characters looked like a hybrid of a lizard an human being. I don't know what James Cameron was thinking when he developed the faces of those creatures. I believe this plays really well into the narrative of the environmentalists. However, I don't find the parallels with the real world especially from the perspective of how human beings heavily rely on fossil fuels for survival and for everything in their daily lives.

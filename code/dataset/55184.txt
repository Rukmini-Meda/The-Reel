 This movie was your pretty basic run of the mill action stooper. The kind of movie that you can only really watch with your brain turned off or it becomes very repetitive and boring. It has a lot of your action stars actually pretty much everyone of them and thats about the only good thing about this movie. The action sequences are OK but the story line is so cliche and unoriginal that it just makes the movie boring.

This movie is about a group of mercenaries who are sent to Latin American to assaisnate a military leader.

This movie was not all bad but I found it just to be so boring cliche and predictable. Maybe if they had added a story line instead of just relying on the sub par acting skills of their all meat head cast.

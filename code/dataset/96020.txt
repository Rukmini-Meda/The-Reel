Expecting to have the ending you want will leave you disappointed. Yet if you go in with the mind set expecting nothing then you will have a good time. The reason this movie was made because there was the first movie that took psychology and computer class with a dab of Japanese animation and made you want more well more less this has been the same thing through out trilogy. So this a movie that follows the same lines so don't get disappointed when you go and see it.

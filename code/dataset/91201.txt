 Amadeus (1984): Dir: Milos Forman / Cast: Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy Dotrice, Jeffrey Jones: Maddening intensity best describe this electrifying masterpiece about composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his ability to conduct original music effortlessly. Screenplay examines his juvenile behavior interlocked with musical plays while detailing his relationships. He is haunted by the inability to please his father. His wife lazes in bed by day yet offers sensible advice. Then there is the court composer who narrates the film in a confession to a Priest in an institution. Director Milos Forman creates one of his best films complete with glorious art direction. Tom Hulce is flawless as Mozart who knows how good he is despite his outbursts in creative expression. F. Murray Abraham plays off the envy of Salieri who hates Mozart yet loves the music to the point where he forces the unfinished final work even when Mozart is on his death bed. Elizabeth Berridge plays Mozart's wife who begins as a free spirit young female until marriage where she can sense Salieri's true nature. Roy Dotrice plays off the haunting presence of Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang's strict father. Jeffrey Jones plays Emperor Joseph the second who is also in attendance. Tremendous film about celebration the talents of others as oppose to surrendering to shortcomings. Score: 10 / 10

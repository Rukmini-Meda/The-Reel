One of the best ways to describe this movie is that it is so realistic, which is also the very reason for my liking. In each phase of the movie, the Russell's character depicts the realistic nature of a human being, which indeed is reinforced by his artistic and more naturalistic way of acting only to make it more realistic and which makes you like it. Connelly is my favorite actress, however I am not biasing when I say, that she has performed her role so beautifully. I just started loving her after I watched this movie. So, basically, the movie is about a maths professor who is so lively and exuberant about his works and always tries to prove something. Is he really working as he thinks he is or is he just fooling himself?? Ron moved the movie so meticulously that the watcher doesn't get deviated or at least doesn't want to. I recommend everyone watch this movie unless they want to miss a work of masterpiece. I bet everyone cried at the end of the movie. I did. Though I guarantee you, its a happy ending. DON'T WAIT UNTIL YOUR LIFE ENDS

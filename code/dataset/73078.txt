Maybe it is simply because I am not from the generation of when this movie came out back in '72, but my god this was a bore.

The acting, the script, and even the set of the movie I found to be quite great, as a matter of fact.

Aside from that, all I got from this movie was a group of men ramble on and on and on about whatever. This movie did not keep me interested at all. The wedding scene was way too long, there is not much of a build up to anything for the most part. It is as if I am watching family members have conversation, and that's it.

The ending scenes I found to be exciting, but at that point I was already tuned out of the movie, and found myself playing temple run just to pass the time. I literally would glance back and forth at the clock just to see how much time this movie took up from my life.

So yeah, this movie was a giant bore-fest for me, giving me little to no motivation to watch Part II and Part III.

A paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. When it comes to movies such as 'Titanic' or 'Avatar' i simply can't ignore the fact that those 2 films are kinda "forgettable" when you compare them with other much better James Cameron films such as 'The Terminator' or 'Terminator 2' or even better 'Aliens' but after seeing 'Avatar' once again i gotta say this film is actually pretty good. Avatar has some really good cgi although not 100% believable James Cameron created a nicely beautiful World with some good and interesting Characters inside it, the acting is also really good by mostly everyone especially Sam Worthington although i felt that Stephen Lang's character was getting annoying after a while. The aircrafts that they use threw out the movie do look like the HK's from T1 and T2 a bit if you think about it and those giant cool looking robots were kinda inspired by Matrix Revolutions (2003) and even that old Superman Cartoon from the 90's. Now where the film kinda struggles is when it comes to it's pacing because the whole 1st act and half of the 2nd act do get a bit slow and although it doesn't completely hurt the film it is still an issue but thankfully the movie picks up from the end of the 2nd half all the way threw the 3rd and personally best act of the movie where it basically turns into a giant war against Blue Aliens and Humans. Many people said that this film isn't quite original and that it mixed Dances with Wolves (1990) with Aliens (1986) and Smurfs and in a way it does in fact mix a lot of different films but that isn't such a big problem if you ask me. What bothers me is the fact that Cameron wants to bring back Sigourney Weaver's character who clearly died and even Lang's character that couldn't even possibly survive those 2 arrows in the chest and even if the film ends with Jake Sully opening his eyes and becoming a full 'Avatar' the movie still doesn't need so many sequels that James Cameron is planning and that is the problem with modern Jim Cameron he is focusing on stuff that don't make sense and especially 'Avatar' that doesn't need any actual sequel and i'm concerned that this might be Cameron's first big mistake but i hope that i'm wrong. As a romance and as a drama 'Avatar' is definitely 10 times better than 'Titanic' and the same goes for it's action but when you start comparing it with T1 and T2, Aliens, True Lies or even The Abyss the movie just looses it's magic against some of 80's and 90's best films. (9/10)

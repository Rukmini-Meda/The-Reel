(Plot credit, IMDb) The mortal son of the god Zeus embarks on a perilous journey to stop the underworld and its minions from spreading their evil to Earth as well as the heavens.

I didn't care for the original, and my views on this one isn't much better. Was a remake warranted? I don't think so. Great talents such as Liam Neeson, Sam Worthington, Etc all give way to the special effects. We get plenty of sword fights in exquisite looking forests, with no intensity mind you, and completely lacking in favor, we have Liam Neeson spurting out ludicrous dialog, nothing really stood out for me.

Bottom line. You can do better. This is basically a special effects extravaganza, nothing more.

4/10

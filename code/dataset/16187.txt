I found it a very good movie, a very good end for the final one and showing among the 3 movies , 3 different perspectives. The first one from the point of view of the humans in the matrix, the second one the point of view of the humans outside the matrix and the third one the real one and how it is. I like the ending cause it was unexpected and of course it didn't pleased the geek fans cause the geeks only think with one type of analisys not froma movie point of view too. Of course it's not perfect but it evolves the idea and keep adding new and very interesting characters like Sati!

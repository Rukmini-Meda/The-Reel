The Matrix Trilogy draws to a close and the final battle between man and machine and between Neo and Agent Smith approaches. Set immediately after the events of 'The Matrix Reloaded' the people of Zion prepare for the attack of the machines while Neo appears to be in a coma back on one of the two ships to have survived the recent conflict. He is in fact trapped somewhere between the real world and the Matrix; in a location that looks like an underground station. If he is to get away he must confront 'The Train Man' and Morpheus and Trinity must re-enter the Matrix and visit The Merovingian once again. Once he is out there problems are far from over; Neo has a feeling that he must head to the City of the Machines, something nobody has successfully done before, and the others must head back to Zion with the last remaining pulse weapon. When the attack begins swarms of Sentinels enter the city dock; they must not be allowed to advance any further or Zion will be lost.

There is plenty of action in this film... too much in fact; the plot lacks the depth of the original leaving us to watch a variety of spectacular fight scenes. These scenes are exciting and look great but go on for too long; while the fighting is going on the plot doesn't advance. At the end there is another Neo vs. Agent Smith fight but after the previous films this has a feeling of inevitability about it. The core cast do well enough although for much of the film they aren't really doing much as everything is focused on the battle for Zion. The military types are all gravel voiced and gung-ho in a way that is almost comical and you just know that the kid who has talked his way into the fight is going to play a key role in the end. It isn't a terrible film; it passes the time well enough and looks good; it is just a bit of a disappointment that the series had to end this way... to be honest I think it would have been better if 'The Matrix' didn't have any sequels as it didn't need them.

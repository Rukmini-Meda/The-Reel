 Peter Shaffer's masterpiece projected on film in the best way possible by the extremely talented director Milos Forman. I've never felt like this for any movie before. It's indescribable. F. Murray Abraham brings an astonishing performance, and so does Tom Hulce. The majority of the scenes are on the comic side, but those dramatic ones aren't missing. Wolfie (Tom Hulce), like his wife Costanze (Elizabeth Berridge) called him, is that childish mastermind, who modesty doesn't apply to throughout all the movie, yet it gives you joy watching him perform. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) on the other hand is portrayed in two personas: young and old. They're quite different from each other. The young one is his position as a court composer for the emperor (Jeffrey Jones), and his old one is that of the narrator of the story. The emperor, now that I mentioned it, is a pulled-back, not-so-obvious character and his performance is hilarious, in my view. What's really about this movie that shouldn't be missed are the operas. Having heard them live is one thing, but this cinematic experience is unforgettable, hence: an omnixperience!

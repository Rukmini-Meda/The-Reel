This film is hopeful, yet tragic at the same time. The story of John Nash is difficult to pick a feeling for. The filmmakers did a fantastic job on it. Once in a while it moves on slowly, but for the most part they hit things interesting. Paul Bettany really brings this movie some life. Of course Russell Crowe does a good job as well.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the story is the part that follows John Nash's wife. She plays a very big part in his life and has a very difficult time balancing everything out. I found her character to be very likable. There is just a good balance with everything in this movie. It is definitely worth your time.

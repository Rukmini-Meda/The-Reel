This is a remake of 1981's Clash of the Titans, where Hades, God of the Underworld (Ralph Fiennes), demands that Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is offered as a sacrifice or he will unleash the Kraken against the Greek City of Argos. Perseus (Sam Worthington), mortal son of Zeus, it asked to defeat the Kraken, resulting in exciting adventures as Perseus and his fellow warriors battle the creatures of the underworld left and right while on a journey to retrieve the head of the stone-turning goron, Medusa (Natalia Vodianova), to use against the Kraken.

Like the original film, Perseus sets off in an incredible quest to find Medusa, filmed in non-stop adventure and action showing the son of Zeus battling hordes of men and creatures that attempt to get in his way. I thought the CGI effects were pretty good and the overall acting wasn't bad.

Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades were the most emphasized gods in the movie, leaving other noted gods such as Poseidon, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Athena, Aries and Apollo on the sidelines. They actually had more screen time filmed and it would have been nice if the director left them in the picture rather than cutting them from the final print, for I thought their roles contributed to the story and the overall mythology element of the movie.

This film, though, does lack the magnificent countryside and renaissance-style scenery you see in the original film, and it does not have that overall classic feel to it. But overall, it is still a nice movie to watch for some decent action and adventure.

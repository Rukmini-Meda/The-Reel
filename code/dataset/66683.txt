"Gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers assured their immortality. As time passed however, mortals began to question them and soon resist their creators, angering them greatly".

I haven't got too much to say about the new "Clash of the Titans", but casting Sam Worthington as Perseus was a somewhat decent choice. Mads Mikkelsen remains as phenomenal as he always is, but Gemma Arteton never really convinces me as actress. Finally, Liam Neeson & Ralph Fiennes are great whining and moaning to each other as Zeus & Hades.

One thing they seemed to have carried forward from the original is the lacking of a decent script, and sadly no Bubo. The set up was pretty much up to standard with the original, however I really didn't think 3D was needed and the ending like most of these kind of movies was horrendously rushed. But sitting there in the theatre and at 18 years of age at the time watching this, I fell back into my childhood memories of seeing many of Ray Harryhausen's work like "Jason & the Argonauts" (1963) coming to life before my eyes. I still think they will continue to remain timeless, and unfortunately this movie will not.

Final Verdict: Not bad, but unnecessary remains the word that best describes this film. 5/10.

This film is NOT a masterpiece. People are simply over hyping this movie because they know that Hollywood has no other films that are superior to this garbage. When it comes to the actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino etc. It becomes obvious throughout the film that they are just actors and did not work that hard to make falseness look like reality. Their performances were terrible and almost ruined half the film for me. The dialogues were not even original. This film is not realistic. Marlon Brando looks like a coca doodle do. How are these characters even supposed to be gangsters when all they do is just kill other gangsters and help the poor and needy people? That's not the acting of a mafia don! Their performances were NOT believable whatsoever. I could tell that they were acting the whole entire time. Constipated looks on the faces of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. This film is a joke! It's funny how everyone says Godfather (an average film at best) is the greatest film of all time but they don't even give any real reasons. What scenes of the film make it so great in the eyes of the audience?

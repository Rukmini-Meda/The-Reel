This film had me captivated from the start and it should be on anyone's watch list. Also anyone who is a fan of Russell Crowe should watch the film. Russell Crowe's acting and the development of his character is of top quality. Anyone who is thinking about a career in acting should watch this film. It is a great film for people of all ages as it is interesting and informative. I could watch this film many times without getting bored. Jennifer Connelly's acting is equally as good as Russell's and her character has a very believable and raw emotional quality to it. Great acting, filming and overall production quality. It is not surprising that it won an academy award for best picture.

1) The movie is extremely summarised at parts, especially in the beginning and at the end. In the beginning, it failed to show how brilliant the man is. At the end, it also failed to show how the man got the noble prize. What did he do to get it? It needed more than these number of scenes. It utterly concentrated on his schizophrenia and this is what point 2 is about.

2) Schizophrenia literally filled all the movie which got really really boring in the middle. Okay, we know he sees things. Let's move on! Show us how we worked to get over it and get the Noble prize.

3) The movie showed that Jack Nash was only running after recognition which I find a bit degrading for such a man.

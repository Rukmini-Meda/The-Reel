Part of the trouble with Les Mis is trying to sum up the entire French Revolution in a musical, which is a strange, even absurd idea. I still prefer the stage version - it has less pretension that this is realistic. As others have said, the CGI in the movie is over-done. The songs and characters don't need over the top design and effects - it's as if the producers felt they had to throw money at each scene and crowd the screen with people and buildings and objects. The Thenardiers' comic Master of the House, for example, was overly elaborate, whereas the lyrics and the couple alone are amusing enough without so many pranks. The casting is uneven. I am not a fan of Hugh Jackman, but he can sing, if not beautifully, and Jean Valjean would have been hard to cast. Anne Hathaway is OK as Fantine but it's a rather pathetic character and not a great stretch for her. Amanda Seyfried is a bit shrill as the older Cosette but again has a bit of a pathetic role. Eddie Redmayne is wonderful as Marius. Not the conventional hunk, but a lovely singer with a good strong screen presence. The other male rebels have those gorgeous rich voices required of all those revolutionary songs. The children playing young Cosette and Gavroche are great. The woman playing the older Eponine has a nice voice and her songs are done well. But she's not convincing in her death scene. Too healthy looking. The technique of the actors singing live is a stroke of genius. Witness brilliant songs like Do You Hear the People Sing or Red and Black and Drink With Me. They're lush and fresh. I had heard that Russell Crowe can't sing but that rumour was wrong. He's not Pavarotti but he acquits himself well in a demanding role as Valjean's nemesis, Javert. The barricade scenes take a while to pick up. They stop and start too much. Les Mis is a hard movie to film, but I felt it could have been done much better.

This movie concludes the trilogy of "The Matrix" series. Neo and the gang are at the mercy of the tech villains. Mr. Smith is ever again relentless in his efforts to stop Neo. Won't that man ever give up? He goes to great lengths of upgrading himself and making duplicates by a deadly touch. Oracle, the wise one is always the toughest next to Morpheus and Neo. And who would have thought than Smith would take over Bane's body. Pure puppetry! And Neo enhanced his other power replaces his eyes when he fought the guy he thought was Bane. The machines in the movie were intense enough to stop a horde of those "locusts" that would damage the ports, and Neo himself would have to defeat Smith once and for all from within. Smith: THE VIRUS! Neo: THE ANTIVIRUS! He couldn't save his love the second time around, but he was able to save the world at the cost of his life. He was definitely a hero at the end. When he will be seen? Only time will tell. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!

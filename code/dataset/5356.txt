Jake is chosen instead of his brother, and ends up rescuing a people. He does so by becoming one of them. Also, in the end, Jake becomes 'born again' as his avatar. The lush jungle-forest of Pandora. The name of this moon-planet comes from the Greek myth of Pandora's box, which, like the Genesis account from which it may even be derived, is about the entrance of evil into an originally innocent, trouble-free world. As he explores this biological wonderland with the innocence of a child, Jake's long blue avatar makes us think of Adam in Eden, especially when he samples an attractive piece of fruit offered to him by his 'Eve'. The forest even has its own special tree of spiritual significance, the Tree of Souls. The Eden parallels have limits things here eat each other, and the Na'vi hunt animals. (OK, they feel sorry for them when they kill them, but it's probably not much consolation for the prey)

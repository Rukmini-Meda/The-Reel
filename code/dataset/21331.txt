 This classic musical is a masterpiece of course and the movie is also very entertaining, emotional and full of action, but must every little bit be sung it does get a bit annoying I mean the main songs are fine but they could just talk normally at some points like Phantom of the opera that is another great musical but not every little bit is sung, anyway that is the only bad thing really the rest of the movie is fantastic so good I got it on DVD of course my favourite song in the whole musical is I dreamed a dream and one day more them to songs just draw me in more to watch, them songs are the main reason I started watching Les Miserables and I will watch many more times.

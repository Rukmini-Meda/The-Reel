I have seen this Movie today, Revolutions has a overdose of CGI, boring fights,cool sun glasses, and Shirow's Mechas, but where are the ideas? The Matrix pretentious franchise ends worse than any other planned trilogy, an ambiguous finish preparing for Matrix 4 that not fill my curiosity. Keanu Reeve`s face look as Rushmore`s one. Why are all the character so retarded? I want Agent Smith Kick Neo's ass, In fact, with Reloaded, the two worst movies ever seen.

You won't get better action then this... this is as old school as can be, and its really good.

Today everything has to be perfect in any way, good story, good cast, good acting, good effects, good CGI etc. This brings us back to the good old principles of movie making, an action movie doesn't have to have the best story, it doesn't have to have overwhelming CGI, it just have to entertain the viewer, have a good hard-hitting cast and a few corny moments and one-liners.

This film takes me back to the good old days, where we all loved the "real" explosions, over buffed cast and characters that could kill hundreds of men without getting much more then a scratch. This is 100% pure action, with all the old dogs and I loved watching it.

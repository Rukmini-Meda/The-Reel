i was worried about how i would feel about this movie after seeing all the negative reviews but i think the negative reviews come from two perspectives; 1) people who only like the matrix for the hong kong style fight sequences, and 2) people who can't follow the movie or don't like the fact that it is not self-contained like the first one.

i'll try not to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it. for me the ending of a movie (or series of movies) is crucial, and if i feel that the ending is weak i can't really like the movie. so like i said i was worried, but i was very happy with the way the storyline was resolved. some of the machine action sequences or battle scenes or whatever didn't do so much for me, but that storyline was fairly necessary for the movie.

all in all i am really looking forward to seeing what the wachowski brothers do next. i really like the philosophical/psychological elements in their films and would really be interested in seeing what they could do with a movie that didn't require so much action and special effects. but i do hope that they might consider going back to some of these characters and telling us more about them. i love the implications of the sati character and would love to see more of the merovingian and persephone. and who could ever get enough of agent smith?

the matrix: 9.5, reloaded: 8 (mostly for the weakness of the first 40 minutes), and revolutions: 9 (for being too dependent on the machine action/battle sequences). it's been a wonderful trip.

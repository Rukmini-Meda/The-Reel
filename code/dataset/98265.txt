During my trip to Talladega for the NASCAR races in 2010 with my dad and a family friend we didn't want to sit in the hotel room all day so we thought why not go to the movies and that's what we did.

However there weren't much of option of the movies we could see in theaters so we agree on the 3D release for Clash Of The Titans.

Now this was my first 3D movie I saw in theaters and it anger me because the 3D effect didn't even happen in the movie only in the previews looking back it should have been a red flag on the film how it would turn out.

Now casting wise Sam Worthington played Perseus Gemma Arterton played lo, Mads Mikkelsen as Draco, Liam Cunningham as Solon, Hans Matheson as Ixas, Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios I liked Liam Neeson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, Danny Huston as Poseidon, Alexander Siddig as Hermes, Luke Evans as Apollo,Nina Young as Hera

With the 3D effects which really wasn't in the film all that often it really hurt the enjoyment of watching this movie. I recently pick it up for DVD just for the sake of collecting all the films I have seen in theaters

Clash Of The Titans I know is a remake and I have yet to seen the original movie.

What I did like about the film was there was some good effects and action scenes that help make the movie interesting enough to watch. Plus the music in the film is good as well and a few scenes with acting

But the movie is pretty much a disappointment, some of the writing feels out of slight out of mind and the 3D effects are pretty much none-existed so it was watching a movie with both eyes closes as well as it was a drain on my eyes to have to rub my eyes through out the movie also there were some scenes that could have been left out of the film but I'll let you see for yourself.

While there could be some interest for those who are fans of the original or someone looking for a movie to watch. I might have enjoy this movie if it didn't feel like it was rush

I give Clash Of The Titans an 6 out of 10

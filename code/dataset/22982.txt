As the summary says, I don't believe this film would stand on it's own if it were not lucky enough to have the Matrix in it's title. Most of this boils down to that I don't believe the Matrix was intended to be anything more than a single movie. The first movie was a trend setter, it inspired an entire new filming technique as is a classic in it's genre. I actually thought Reloaded was clever, at least it provoked thought and discussion. I can't think what kind of discussion Revolutions will provoke apart from discussions of disappointment. It is poorly scripted, lamely acted, and generally substandard. I am not even annoyed that 'my questions are not answered', it is just poor in comparison to the others.

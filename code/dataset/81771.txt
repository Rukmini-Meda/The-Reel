I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.

However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.

Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays!

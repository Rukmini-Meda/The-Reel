I am surprised that at this moment, this film only got a 5.6 rating. I was going to rate it 8, but now I am rating it a 9.

I loved it its intense special effects, and its intense sound effects. After all, that is what big disaster movies are all about.

The storyline may not be very strong, but it is supposed to entertain us. And I was truly entertained for over two hours. This is a movie well done. There was a few dull moments, but overall, it is big.

I watched it on DVD, I should have watched it in a big theater with a big screen. The special effects were purely amazing! One problem with this movie is its lack of Chinese people. After all, the ships were supposed to be built in China. There was no Chinese leaders or many Chinese people shown in the movie.

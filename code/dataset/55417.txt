The new series of movies are as if the they are not made by the same person. Actually, in a way, they aren't. They where made by an aging fart who decided to make a kids movie. If you believe that a grate kids movie will be grate for adults then I'll tell you that this isn't one of those. The movie (whole quasi-star wars prequel trilogy) lacks the mysticism of the original series. Thats the main problem. In the original trilogy you had knights, wizards, spiritual power and a princess. In the new series you only have a princess and wannabe knights and wizards with some kind of organism living in them which gives them the force (what????). Where is that Lucas from the 70's gone? The one that wrote about people with unexplainable powers, a force flowing through them that is in all living things. A concept heavily borrowed from the eastern philosophies which gave the films spiritual and mystical note. If you liked the original trilogy for those reasons then avoid the new films at all costs. They are childish crap.

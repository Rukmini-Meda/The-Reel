 It deserves every nomination and every rewards and even more. So breathtaking and heartbreaking a lot of people not much into musical but this one is absolutely exception the music is so beautifully sequenced and I'm not going to say anything about the lyrics simply blow me away especially " Suddenly " Hugh did a remarkable job I read the novel though this film wasn't originally taken from the novel but Hugh managed to convey JeanValjean character and all his pain and how he changed his life and dedicated his life to protect Cozette . I was speechless when I finished it . I can promise you this that this movie is going to make you realize about so many things in life .

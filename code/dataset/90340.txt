 The Expendables was released in 2010 and is directed, written and starring Sylvester Stallone. It,s co-stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren and many more. This movie was is a throwback to the 80,s and 90,s action movies and does an okay favor to that premise but still has a hole lot of flaws. The Expendables is about Barney Ross who leads the "Expendables", a band of highly skilled mercenaries including knife enthusiast Lee Christmas, martial arts expert Yin Yang, heavy weapons specialist Hale Caesar, demolitionist Toll Road and loose- cannon sniper Gunner Jensen. When the group is commissioned by the mysterious Mr. Church to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island, Barney and Lee head to the remote locale to scout out their opposition. Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul. The Expendables is an entertaining stupid movie but most of that entertainment comes from the stars and how fun it is to see all these actors come together and kick some ass together. But the flaw is that none of these stars has an real character unless Stallone, Statham, Rourke and Lundgren. And it,s really annoying that Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are terrible misused. The quality of the film is straight to DVD like with i'ts CGI blood effects and stupid script. There are some cool explosions and i'ts fun to see all these guys together. The Expendables is an entertaining action movie that you can turn you're brain off while watching it.

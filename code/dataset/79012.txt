The action of this film is explosive and titanic and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in an action movie. The soundtrack (expecionally in the Credits) is titanic, colossal and unique. Visual effects remain excellent, even after 13 years. Yes, I saw it in theaters in 2013. Smith remains a great villain and Keanu as Neo remains iconic. The final battle in Zion and the final fight between Agent Smith and Neo goes down in history as two of the best demonstrations of visual effects that someone has created.

The great sin of this film, that mystery and aura cease to exist, especially since the first Matrix. But it's still a great action movie and an astounding ending to the Neo saga.

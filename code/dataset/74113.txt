I really have to laugh when I read the negative reviews of this movie as if the writers were asked to give a critical review of a true piece of art. Let's face it: art films don't make money because they're not that entertaining films, and entertaining films generally are not artful. So what? I've watched 2012 several times on DVD and I am always entertained. I don't need to sit and analyze the science or even the dialogue. Yes, I like special effects but I also like survival movies. Sure, the protagonists seem to escape every possible death trap, but what would be the point of killing off these folks along the way. Then you really would have no story. I think that those who fault the movie, especially the plot, have not actually watched it beginning to end. I don't judge it in anyway other than what it sets out to do--entertain--and that it did for me. I am sure that all these negative critics, if asked how they would improve it, would come up with a number of changes that overall would not produce a vastly better movie.

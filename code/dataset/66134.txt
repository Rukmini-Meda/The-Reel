Having now seen the full trilogy along with The Animatrix, I feel that it is safe to say that the body of work is quite an achievement. While I did prefer the original, I don't think that it is necessarily due to the quality of the film as much as the fact that it was my first venture into the world of the Matrix. I feel quite strongly that the original film has been grossly overrated despite being a good movie. It was just as porous in its logic, and certainly the corniest of the trilogy.

The last film is perhaps the coldest of the three, and yet the most intellectually interesting. The first barely contained much originality of philosophy. With each film, however, the trilogy veered off further and further into surreal philosophy. Still, although the most interesting, it's that coldness and detachment that made me like this film the least.

I am sure this, like Lord of the Rings, will go down in history and become a beloved trilogy. To me, however, it is the achievement of the films moreso than the films themselves that impress. Unlike the original three star wars, I do not hold a special place in my heart for these films. Instead I look back upon them as a piece of film history.

The one piece I will remember is The Animatrix. Now THAT was a great work.

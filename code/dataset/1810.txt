 I don't know where to start? I gave it 2 viewings before coming back after a good nights sleep and had stopped swearing at the terrible stereotypes (especially the Russians, my god Hollywood types are dense). The script, if you can call it that is just ludicrous with nothing of note, nothing even remotely resembling witty, compelling, scientific or just plain interesting to keep a person in their seat. The visuals, well they looked clunky to be honest, the sort of wholesale destruction and amount of energy released to achieve it would have made most scenes a smoky grey ash haze but reality never intrudes in movie world so they were clear and clean and totally unbelievable as a result. I don't care how good your driving or your stretch limo is, you get amongst that lot for real and you die. I guess if hopeless pilots with box cutters can bring down steel framed and concrete high rise buildings in New York then sure, some plastic cutter can fly a twin engine slow plane through disaster even better than a limo can drive through it. From there it just gets worse, terrible stereotypes of the Russian billionaire and his girlfriend and family/pilot etc...yet Americans hate being stereotyped themselves so why do it? More special effects that wasted good computing power and money to achieve no impact and some cursory humanity to let a few unwashed masses aboard the arks in the face of the latest setback at that point. Why bother? like nuclear Armageddon the living will envy the dead. Another critic wrote that burning the money and filming it would have been more dramatic, I agree. Stay away from this unless you have eaten something bad and need to vomit without taking ipecac to get that started, this will do it for you!

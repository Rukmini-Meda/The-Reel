Les Miserables absolutely blew me away. I simply never cry at movies, but throughout large chunks of this one, I was on the verge of tears.

Admittedly, it does have a couple of mitigating factors which predestine me to look favourably on it - a nostalgic glow from my childhood memories of the songs, and the fact that it seems to me an openly theistic film - and yes, director Tom Hooper uses every trick in the book to pull at the heart-strings.

However, there is no denying the strength (and bleakness) of the story, the strength of the cast who all sing and act out of their skins. With the exception of slight accent troubles with one or two characters, the film absolutely excels in every single area, achieving near-perfection in the field of cinema.

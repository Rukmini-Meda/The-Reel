Avatar is one of those rare films that change the world. Some people criticise it's story, saying it's predictable and un-inventive. But they miss the point.

Avatar's greatness comes from the way it changed the way people view movies, the way they view the world and the way it resonates at a far deeper level than just the story or visuals. It pulls at the raw associations we all have with the world around us. It's beauty making you stop and think - what have we done? And suddenly you come a little closer to understanding the feelings of native tribes around the world as mining and forestry companies push them aside to destroy their forests, all to make a few more dollars.

Avatar has done more for the awareness of what we are doing the the planet than decades of protests and petitions.

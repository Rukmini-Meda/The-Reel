I was initially reluctant to watch the movie as I had just watched the " Theory of Everything", but was eventually convinced by the raving reviews on IMDb.

The movie is about the story of a brilliant, introverted, shy and often arrogant man named John Nash, a great mathematician who has made fundamental contributions to the fields of computing, evolutionary biology, economics and many more.

The movie highlights Nash's struggle to break through in the field of science and his far more daunting struggle with paranoid schizophrenia a mental illness that begins to afflict him in his 30's and nearly devastates his career.

Ron Howard unfolds the story through Nash's point of view and this helps to shine light onto the true chilling and terrible nature of paranoid schizophrenia in a way that no medical textbook can. We watch in horror as Nash's life crumbles before his eyes when he realizes that his best friend, and occupation are just figments of his imagination. The power of love and hope are shown as Nash's wife single-handedly supports the family and prevents Nash from falling apart and succumbing to his delusions.

Russell Crowe's acting is phenomenal and he brings life to John Nash in a way that that I doubt no other actor can.

This is a heart-wrenching, amazing true story about the life of a troubled man with a beautiful mind, and is one of the best movies I have ever watched.

10 stars.

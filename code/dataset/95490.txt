From Roland Emmerich, a man who likes to destroy things on screen comes the apocalyptic disaster film 2012. Its 2012 and the scientists have discovered that the earth's core is melting, the crust will shift and lave will spew out causing earthquakes and rising tides. Even the poles would shift.

Politicians, rich oligarchs, various royal families and a few conspiracy nuts know of the imminent disaster and have started planning for it by means of survivals arks being built in China. However a place in the ark comes with a huge price.

John Cusack goes all out to get his ex-wife and kids to safety by tagging along with a rich Russian.

Danny Glover is the US President who opts to stay in Washington. Oliver Platt is the realist but harsh Chief of Staff. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of the scientists who alerted the government of the impending doom but fearful that the rich and powerful will callously leave millions to die.

The cheese-fest is dialled up to 11 as Cusack just escapes disaster by car and plane. Roads splits, buildings come crashing down, volcanoes erupt. Emmerich even blows up the White House once again amongst other landmarks.

Its like a roller-coaster ride but the characterisations are a bit paper thin, some of the effects look a bit too much green screened. A good end of the world flick with some tongue in cheek humour.

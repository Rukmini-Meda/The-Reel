 I cannot say how much I liked this film, and the main reasons were the humor and Jason Statham. The one liners involving Stallone were priceless, and Lee Christmas (Statham)steals every scene he is in. My favorite was after this abusive guy hits Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) the woman he loves, he beats the you know what out of him and his friends, taking his knife to the basketball, slashing it, and telling Lacy "Now you know what I do for a living." (He did not want her to know he was a mercenary. But he knew that although she loved him, in order to have her, he had to come clean). This film after "Red" is the best pure action film of the 21st Century, and it should be a must see (I want to see "Expendables 2" and then part 3. 10/10 stars.

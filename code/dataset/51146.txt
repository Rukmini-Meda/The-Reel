Author Victor Hugo would have been very proud of this 2012 adaptation of his memorable classic.

Folks, why are people criticizing Russell Crowe's singing voice? He was quite good and he reminded me somewhat of Charles Laughton in the mid 1930s dramatic adaptation. Crowe is relentless in his pursuit of Jean Valjean.

Hugh Jackman was magnificent in the title role.

There is certainly revolution in the air in this endearing film. Anne Hathaway, as the tragic Fantine, was good, but in no way should have been considered for the best supporting actress award.

This is a film dealing with injustice, obsession with the law, tragedy, love and hate. Human understanding is the ultimate redemption here.

Is this movie bad? yeah ofc, but it is still entertaining while watching it and has decent visual effects with passable action scenes. The acting is almost non-existent, although i did enjoy Liam Neeson as Zeus. I haven't seen the original because i wasn't born when it came out and i only heard about it when i read the reviews for this movie. I agree that most reboot/remakes are garbage but you should judge a movie as its own thing before comparing to other crap from your childhood.

Overall not very good but if you are home alone on a wet day and there is nothing else to watch and you don't mind poorly acted movies then give this a shot, you might end up enjoying it.

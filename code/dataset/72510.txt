I'm not sure why this film is so low rated, of the three Matrix films I feel this is the only one that lives up to the genius of the first and is almost, almost as good. I remember liking this in my teens when the film first came out so I recently went back to make sure my sentiment hadn't been complete hogwash brought on by excess youth. As it turns out I liked it even more than I expected.

The visuals this film gives are some of the best ever done in film, and bring the sci-fi world of the Matrix to life in incredible detail and beauty. If this isn't enough the film gives a spring-board of thought provoking dialog that likely explains why so many film-goers left disappointed, not everyone appreciates a little philosophy in their action film the way I do. Despite some confusing dialog and an at first (to me) ambiguous ending I feel this film is extraordinarily underrated...

Perhaps movie goers wanted to see more of the characters inside the Matrix, unfortunately that's not where the story takes place for the most part. I loved the Zion fights for survival story, the gritty colors and depressed faces tell of a distraught future where survival for humanity isn't guaranteed.

There are so many original and semi-original ideas within the Matrix Trilogy is boggles the mind, but where some see plagiarism I see genius. After all what is Star Wars but archetypes, ideas, motifs, all placed together in an original recipe, the chef did not invent the egg, but he did cook the omelet.

Themes of causality, purpose, choice, control, love, the very fabric of humanity is spoken of in this film, add that to the mind-shattering special effects and you have, in my mind, one of the best film series ever created, and Revolutions is right up there with the best sci-fi films ever made...

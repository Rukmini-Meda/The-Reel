Bad Points

> Every single character is a stereotype > It's overly long, with lots of repetition in terms of the action > The underlying story is much more simple than the film makers seem to understand > They massively over do the "only just making it" action scene, there are about 10 of them > Nothing interesting happens at any point > CGI fest, you don't need that many scenes of destruction in a film > No real love interest > The All American speeches > The music sounds like it's been in about 500 different Hollywood films since the mid 90s

No real good points, but the acting isn't especially bad. Basically it's your standard awful family movie. I would have been really irked if I'd seen this in a cinema and had to sit through it all at once.

 This movie is a real man's movie! You got all the action, all the power, and everything else in between. You gotta have some humor to get along with, otherwise this movie would be boring. Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are the powerhouses of the team. Elite mercenaries who do dangerous missions and get paid for it. However, there was a member of the team who gets careless and ends up messing up. Whoever it was, I'm not saying. The action is nonstop, and there are some scenes that closely like some of Sly's earlier movies. The street scene resembles the 1986 movie "Cobra". He has another souped up classic Ford truck. Lundgren and Stallone starred in "Rocky IV". I guess you can call it a small reunion together. Well, it's true! This movie also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis in small, minute roles. The storyline is unbelievable, the action as well. The Expendables will leave you on the edge of your seat! 3.5 out of 5 stars!

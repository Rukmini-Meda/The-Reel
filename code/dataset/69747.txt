I'm very angry. Not at Revolutions, at you! You people who didn't even bother to go see this movie because you didn't like the second. Well shame on you.

I believe for the final installment in one of the biggest movie trilogies, Revolutions was above exceptional. The ambiance and dramatic mood throughout the movie was a wise choice by the Wachowski brothers. Many of the un-answered questions that left you cliffhanging in the second are answered. And I understand that some questions weren't answered, and for those I ask you to refer to perhaps The Aniematrix or some of the movies special features.

The acting is good, especially Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Morpheus (Luarence Fishburne). Other characters include Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). The action is incredible. A 20 minute war scene between the robots and the humans might possibly be the most amazing thing you'll ever see sitting in a movie theater too.

But seriously, this movie was over-looked and didn't deserve enough respect that it should have. The conclusion to the most famous trilogy of all time, beside LOTR, was not a let down at all. See it, it will blow you away.

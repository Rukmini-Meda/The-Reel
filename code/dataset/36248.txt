Star Wars is one of my favorite movie franchises. To think of what could have come before the original trilogy used to fill me with wonder, until I saw this movie. The sheer shittiness of this "movie" highlights George Lucas's lack of talent as a director and a writer, and proves once and for all that Star Wars succeeded only because there were people around Lucas who challenged his idiocy. The lack of ambition and imagination that went into the Phantom Menace disgusts me.

It makes me wonder if Lucas even had any creativity to begin with. When on the lease of a production company that fought him at every turn he created one of the greatest films in history, but when left to his own devices, he forever brought shame to his legacy.

Neo is stuck in the Matrix without being plugged in. He finds that his powers are expanding. The danger from the spreading Agent Smiths is also expanding. Meanwhile the machines are closing in on Zion, and the survivors are preparing for the last stand.

The Matrix double talk continues. It continues to confound. The ultimate ending seems random. This is strictly to wrap things up. And they get to blow lots of stuff up in the CG world. The best part is the battle in Zion. It is super fun, wildly chaotic, and overwhelming. The big CG battle looks really good. The Neo part of the movie is just too convoluted and random. I don't understand how he defeated Agent Smith. Maybe the fact that he did is all that is necessary to know.

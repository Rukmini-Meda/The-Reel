A gangster film that is philosophical at its core. Truly the hallmark of good film-making. This film is a timeless reminder to filmmakers that you don't need death-defying stunts and fast-paced actions to make a good gangster film. The characters are well-developed and the pace of the film is pretty intriguing; the film kick-started with sweet little moments of life and then ended in a rather morbid note.

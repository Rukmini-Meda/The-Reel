James Cameron's 'Avatar' is 100% a masterpiece. It is by far the most impressive film ever made in the visual department. it took a lot of efforts and years of waiting to come up with such an advanced CGI effects and motion captures. to this day, 7 years after avatar was released, i haven't seen even one movie that can be compared with avatar's visually beauties. No, Avatar doesn't resemble Pocahontas in any way. It doesn't have any direct connection to other films. It is an original story, which is refreshing since most of the new movies are based upon or rebooting something else. James Cameron made the two most financially successful movies of all time - 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', and it's not a coincidence. This guy is a real genius! I recommend Avatar to ANYONE who appreciate the art of films and the fact that a movie is not perfect without it's beauties and visual factors. 10 out of 10. an unworldly masterclass!

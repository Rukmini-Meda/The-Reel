I never felt so much love for a science fiction movie in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised for the brilliant character development, the slow yet perfect story development, the music is so addicting to the point of buying (which I did), and every second draws you in. I loved the imagination, the art, and I have watched the commentary.

I will admit also the book (the education book about the Na'Vi mentioned by Grace) is a great read. I recommend buying that from amazon!

I love the song so much. The melody, the singing songstress they picked sang my other favorite song (Anastasia) "At the Beginning," and I truly enjoy the saying as well.

"I see you." Seeing deeper than looks, deeper than words but seeing the true, loving and caring person within the masks. I adore the romance too.

the intimacy scene....WOW. true, this was not as racy as some romance movies but I loved the connection and passion shared between Netriki and Jake.

I am proud to say even after seeing this movie over a dozen times. I still watch without distraction and enjoy every second. I cannot wait for the next one and after that.

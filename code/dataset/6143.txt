 This is by far my favorite film due to its excellent music, acting, and story line. The first aspect that especially caught my attention was the fact that the actors sang the entire film live. Not only did they do a fantastic job vocally, but this aspect made this film unique from the rest. Secondly, the directors did an excellent job in casting for the film. Each actor/actress was a perfect fit for each roll and they did a great job portraying the character through their personality, costumes, and mannerisms. Lastly, the directors did a great job in turning a well-known play into an enjoyable film. Although it is common for people to be disappointed after watching a film that is based off of a play, this film exceeds many expectations. I would personally recommend this film to anyone who has read the novel, seen the live performance, or just loves musicals in general!

 Now obviously there is no such thing as a perfect film but Amadeus comes pretty damn close. The lavishly, eloquent, accurate costumes, the beautifully performed score, the wonderfully mixed sound design, and of course some of the greatest acting ever put to celluloid. Do be sure to watch the Director's Cut though.

I remember watching 'Avatar' in cinema. It was a beautiful experience to watch, but way too long in running time and predictable in storyline after only 5 minutes.

James Cameron's ongoing same storyline of human industrialism pushing the buttons and finally costing our heads is always present in his movies. Wheter it is about fictional human inventions like a Terminator, exploring space and bumping into a bunch of predator aliens (I know he made a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved with, but still...), the forces of nature in 'Titanic' and so on, Cameron didn't even try to come up with an original storyline in this one.

Instead, the story weighs heavily on beaten paths, predictable story lines and stereotype characters in a movie that could have been so much more.

I cannot bear watching it anymore. Maybe for about 45 minutes and then I'm bored to death, even slightly irritated.

It's a shame, because it is such a beautiful experience for our ocular organs.

It's a pity. A lost chance.

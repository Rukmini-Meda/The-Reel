Watched my favorite Movie of All time Star Wars:The Phantom Menace which in My opinion is not only the greatest Sci-Fi Movie of All Time But also The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Ewan McGregor(Trainspotting) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Liam Neeson(Schindlers List) as Qui-Gon Jinn , the lovely Natalie Portman(Leon The Professional) as Padme Amidala, ,Jake Llyod(Jingle All The Way) as Young Anakin Skywalker,Ahmed Best(Instant Zoom) as Jar Jar Binks,Samuel L. Jackson(Pulp Fiction) as Mace Windu ,Ray Park(Mortal Kombat:Annilation) as Darth Maul , Brian Blessed(One We Were Warriors) as Boss Nass, Silas Carson(Fever Pitch) as Nute Gunray/Ki-Adi-Mundi, Andy Secombe(Peak Practice) as Watto, Pernilla August(Gossip) as Shmi Skywalker, Keira Knightley(Bend It Like Beckham) as Sabe ,Frank Oz(The Muppet Movie) as Master Yoda and Ian McDarimid(Sleepy Hallow) as Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious. The The Film is the best out o the Star Wars Saga with The High Octane Political Underpinnings with a brilliant Story and fantastic visuals and the best Lightsaber fight Between Obi- Wan Kenobi, Qui- Gon Jinn & Darth Maul in The Epic Duel Of Fates , Amazing Cinematography By David Tattersall(The Green Mile),Production Design By Gavin Bocquet(Kafka) and Special Effects By Dennis Muren(T2 Judgement Day) ,Amazing Direction from The King of Star Wars Himself George Lucas(American Graffiti ), Fantastic Costume design from Trisha Biggar(Young Indiana Jones ) and Amazing Score from John Williams(Jurassic Park) definitely one of my favorite movies ever 10/10

Whether or not the special effects and martial arts were as exciting as in the first two movies, if you enjoyed the references to philosophy, mythology, and theology in the first two, then I think you will love this one. If you are the kind of person who gets more enjoyment out of the movie by knowing the meanings of "Morpheus," "Merovingian," "Logos," "Mifune," "Ramachandra," "Sati," etc., you will get a whole extra level of pleasure out of this movie. If you enjoy recognizing references to other movies, there will be plenty of that for you. If this kind of thing sounds incredibly boring to you, then you might want to set your expectations lower.

The film was advertised as a throwback to action movies of the 80's and 90's.The actions scenes were definitely huge and excessively violent.No question that action film lovers will definitely enjoy and will be enormously entertained watching this movie.Too bad that despite the talent involved,the film came out to be just ordinary for there is nothing really new or groundbreaking.Besides,the only achievement it managed to get is to have great action stars get assembled in one big film.

 Jean Valjean, known as Prisoner 24601, is released from prison and breaks parole to create a new life for himself while evading the grip of the persistent Inspector Javert. Set in post-revolutionary France, the story reaches resolution against the background of the June Rebellion. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway give 2 amazing stand out performances the same goes for Russell Crowe and this is without a doubt the best Musical since Sweeney Todd there's a little bit of actual dialogue but the biggest part of the film is songs and the movie is really heart breaking especially the ending and i will definitely give it a 10 out of 10.

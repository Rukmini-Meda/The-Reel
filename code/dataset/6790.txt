 My review for 2012 is very much overdue. I didn't review it earlier because to me it was perfect. Firstly, I had no problem with the movie as I am a number one fan of Roland Emmerich. I went to watch this for all the awesome effects even if some of them were a bit unrealistic as some would say. But hey, this is one of the best disaster movies of our time if you don't mind some funny bits. I gave this movie a 10 for all the blow it up stuff I always wanted. The story is your basic look at our hero of the day who just happens to be a frustrated divorced writer and drives a limousine for rich people. Not much of a story really although it tries to stick with it even after all the running around and getting on something in the nick of time. I know most of it was ridiculous, but I ain't stupid I just enjoyed it for what it was. An earthquake of that magnitude in this movie? You couldn't run, walk or even drive around like John Cusack did, and he wasn't even a professional race car driver. And I know from personal experience with earthquakes with lesser magnitude. But like I said, I came for the destruction and I got what I wanted and I hope Emmerich keeps doing movies like this forever. Blow up and destroy more stuff for us Roland!!!

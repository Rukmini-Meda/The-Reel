When I first watched this movie I was a bit skeptical as to how it would turn out, after all, when a movie has to include so many famous actors and actresses in it, it generally spells disaster and the writing and directing fall so short that the movie is a train wreck, nothing short of abominable. With Les Mis, not so.

Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job with his role as the incredibly conflicted Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway was brilliant as well, even though we didn't see much of her. My personal favorite character though was Javert.

Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job with his part and I really enjoyed seeing a different side to Javert, not just the evil man that a lot of actors portray when they play the part. All in all I really couldn't call him a villain because he was so convinced that Valjean was the criminal and when he finally came to terms with the fact that Valjean had changed it wasn't that he just didn't want to believe it, it was that he had wasted umpteen years of his life chasing down a man who proved that everything he believed was false.

The music was wonderful and some of the sets they had were breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop scene when Javert was singing Stars because it was just a really beautiful scene.

The film was fairly emotional, barring the occasional moments where my father would sigh and upset the feeling of the scene, as he did not feel quite as enthused about being there as I was.

The last few scenes will leave you weeping so bring some Kleenex, and don't wear eyeliner.

Overall it was a fantastic movie.

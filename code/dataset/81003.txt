Although this film was slow paced, it was kept a float with Russell Crowe's best performance.

The screenplay was excellent, as was of course Ron Howard's directing.

The writing was great and I found the story kept my attention throughout the entire film.

The performances by Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly and Christopher Plummer where excellent.

Certainly worth seeing.

It's an 8/10 from me!

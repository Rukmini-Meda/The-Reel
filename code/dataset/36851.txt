The first movie in The Matrix Trilogy is the best one but The Matrix Revolutions brings the first movie's feeling back again and does a great job in terms of story telling, special FX and also being unpredictable and surprising it's viewers.

(Gloria Foster's dead is a big loss for the movie. Mary Alice does a great job as The Oracle (with the new skin!) but I'd really love to see Foster as The Oracle for the last time, in that kitchen with (Agent) Smith, under the pouring rain after the final fight and talking to The Architect and watching the sunrise with Seraph and Seti at the end of the movie. She was one of my favorite actors in the cast. Gloria, rest in peace.)

It really is one of the most underrated movies of all times but anyway, this trilogy changed everything. There is before it and after it. A must see. Free your mind!

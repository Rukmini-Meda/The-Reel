I just don't know why some people hated this awesome disaster movie, for my a really great movie, is a movie that can be watched, again and again and again.

The special effects are incredible, watch it in HD on Blu-ray, pause the action sequences, there's just so much happening in each frame it's just amazing.

The story and plot are easy to follow, now and again, I love to just relax and watch it for the roller-coaster non-stop thrill ride it truly is.

I can count on my hand how many movies are actually worth watching more than once and this is one of them.

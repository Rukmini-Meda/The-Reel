Without a doubt, the most hated in the Series. Fan were so excited to see this, but felt the Cinema feeling empty inside.

I have to be honest; this is what got me into Star Wars in the first place. I loved this movie a lot, I thought it was amazing, but then after watching the Original Trilogy, I realized how much this sucked and that is wasn't the masterpiece I thought it was.

Crappy acting, bad special effects, Yoda looks more like a Muppet than ever before and also...Jar Jar Binks...the only redeeming factor of this film is the Duel of Fates, which is probably the best part in film, since all we get is fart jokes from a certain Gungan.

Darth Maul was so cool and looked so evil and intimidating, until he got killed off, but thank Lucas for "The Clone Wars".

From the moment I saw the original musical on Broadway I fell in love with Les Mis!

I am so glad they decided to bring it to the film so the future generations can enjoy all that glory and music this masterpiece of the World Heritage brought to us! What is better about this masterpiece, is it the plot, the music or acting? What can you add about a classic like this except Bravo! Bravissimo!!! I can spend many more lines praising this masterpiece above all, but why should I do that, when all the best was already written about Les Miserables!

Loved it, watched it many times over, with the kids and without them! So please do the same!

It really belongs to the highest levels of human achievement in art!

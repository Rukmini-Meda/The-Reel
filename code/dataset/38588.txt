I had no desire at all to watch this film, even after countless trailers and clips I watch of the film. My drive went from zero to a minus ha. However, I thought to myself, I'm setting up a Movie Blog I need to expand my horizons a bit and watch films I wouldn't usually watch. So here is my review for the film in my heart I knew I would despise.

Tom Hooper usually makes films that do not peak my interest, they are very much award orientated films and that's just not me.

The film revolves around an ex-convict known Jean Valjean (Jackman) as he tries to reinvent his life after he is convicted with petty theft, now trying to become a very model citizen. No matter how hard he may try, Inspector Javert (Crowe) a very dedicated lawman who will take down his man no matter how well his life has turned around.

Valjean's life is now better than he probably ever expected, he's now a very wealthy man, mayor of his town and Javert accidentally comes across him, both mean realising who the other is setting up a long and arduous chase by Javert to catch his man. Even if that means decades of chasing and hunting him throughout a student uprising resulting in pretty severe war time.

The film is acted beautifully by the entire cast and I usually shy away from praising an entire cast, however I can't say anybody in this film gave a less than stellar performance. Jackman portrays a very wounded and pain driven man, his best acting performance to date.

Overall, I can HIGHLY recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of this kind of film, it may be long but there is no point in which you're thinking about time. However, you will definitely need a toilet break at some point. My favourite performance from the entire film came from unknown Samantha Barks playing Eponin, she was a revelation, hope she goes onto much bigger things.

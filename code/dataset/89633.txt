'The Godfather' - who not seen it yet, as not been live, cult and excellent movie, one of (not just) my favorite. I love godfather, i can see it, maybe...maybe, 10x, maybe 15x and every time I look like child which get new toy. Music is one of the best ever (not just OST), camera is also brilliant, ALL actors are daring and stunning as director of this spectacle. And Fredo Corleone is adorable. Everyone, must see it, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone. 100%, 10/10, 5/5, 4/4 or how you want. Just...just WOW. Thank you to all the crew of the film, you are all worthy of an Oscar.

 It's a good movie but the book was better and the movie left out many things. Also there were too many close ups. However the heaven at the end was not especially realistic. It showed Gavroche, Fantine, and Eponine as well as some revolutionaries all in an endless barricade. Heaven is supposed to be a better place but instead everyone still looked gaunt and worn down. The movies highlights were A Heart Full of Love by Eponine, Marius, and Cosette, I Dreamed a Dream by Fantine, and the end song where Valjean dies. The song at the inn was truly hilarious with a few inappropriate scenes for younger viewers. The scene where the revolution actually takes place was quite sad. Some of my favorite characters died. As a previous review said, some of the songs sounded quite like the others and it was sort of confusing. A few of the characters' actions were not very believable and too good to be true. I do believe that some of the casting could have been better. Russell Crowe is not exactly the best singer. Anne Hathaway was great though. Again, I Dreamed a Dream was filled was so much emotion and told a story all on its own.

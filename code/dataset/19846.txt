 The story of what music meant to an aging "Patron Saint of Mediocrity" told to a young priest by our afflicted Soliere after being committed to a sanitarium. This ranks as my top musically oriented masterpiece. The symphonies and operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hauntingly decorate the jealous and humorous results of those surrounding the King and his minions in their attempts to corral the young, but gifted, composer. Tom Hulce (as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is absolutely passionate about his perfect music and F. Murray Abrahams' Soliere is a genuine gift in expressing many a musicians frustration of never reaching Gods' ears with ones works. The idea of mediocrity being a sin is expressed by our anti-hero so well at the end that I always reflect on my own limited musical expressions. Well, there it tis!

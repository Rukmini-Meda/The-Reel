What an imposing array of muscle superstars. It must be a sure hit! But ...

Lets set aside the normal parameters, script, dialog, acting, suspense, comedy etc. etc. Another parameter is ruining movie and TV production in general - speed cutting!

This film is a horrible example of poor filming and moronic cutting. The MTV dogma of stroboscopic cutting, no cuts over 2 seconds and 1/2 second cuts in abundance, is ruling. And it is so tiresome. It is so useless. The producer and director think they are hip and cool but they are in fact pretentious, conceited and lazy. Lazy because they can skip so much preparation when only 1/2 a second has to succeed in each shot. Speed cutting is the lazy directors fast road to fake action.

Speed cutting has taken over the world of film and TV and every producer/director is frightened to death not to be regarded as hip if they don't submit to the dogma. IT IS WORTH NOTHING TO THE VIEWER!

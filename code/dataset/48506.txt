As of this writing, I have about 90 reviews on IMDb. I'd only began submitting reviews a few years ago, so the films I'd seen in the past were never reviewed by me. I thought I'd take the time now to give a quick review of the 10/10 films I'd seen in my life.

First one up is "Amadeus," and to me, the best film ever made. It's the movie I compare all others to, including classics like "The Godfather," "Citizen Kane," and "Schindler's List."

"Amadeus" has it all - excellent acting, excellent cinematography, excellent costume design, excellent music production, excellent set design, perfect combination of comedy and tragedy, and tons and tons of classic, memorable lines, especially those delivered by Salieri. I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out. I was 18 years old and it made me fall in love with classical music.

Director Milos Forman is truly a wonder, given that he's helmed quite a few films that made my top 25 list - "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime." How fitting it should be, then, that my favourite song of all time appears in one of his films, "Hair." Coincidence? I think not. The man's a genius, plain and simple. He's also caused me to structure some of my screenplays and novels based on "Ragtime." Talk about influential.

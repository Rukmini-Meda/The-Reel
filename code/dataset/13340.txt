 Les Miserables is a heart-felt story about an escaped convict during the French Democratic Revolution. Jean Valjean, the escaped convict played by Hugh Jackman, sang soulfully about his struggles but also triumphantly how he turned his life around. When he gave his soul to God, he vowed that he had a duty to be a better person and to serve others. The character was well-played by Jackman because his appeal was infectious. Other characters in the movie, such as Fantine played by Anne Hathaway, touched many hearts in the audience. Through loud sobs and gasps, Hathaway sang the famed "I Dreamed a Dream" with as much despair and as much feeling as she could. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, and Amanda Seyfried, also prominent figures in the movie, represented the hardships of love. Barks was a third wheel in the love triangle between Seyfried, Redmayne, and Barks. When Barks's character Eponine sings her iconic song "On My Own," audience members can empathize and relate to her story, and that's what makes her character a protagonist. Lastly, the Revolution was portrayed as a momentous struggle for freedom of democracy, and it really captured the historical essence of the complication. Not all of the big names in the film did a fantastic job singing-wise, but the acting and portrayal of the characters was beyond outstanding. Even to someone who doesn't like musicals, the songs in Les Miserables are catchy and emotion-filled.

I decided to watch Amadeus because I thought it was a comedy of some sort and I just wanted to watch something to have a good time. I really was not expecting the masterpiece that I was about to watch.

Amadeus is a wonderful film that portrays the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It portrays it in such a way that you are always paying attention and it never gets boring.

The film is told through the eyes of Salieri. Another musician who was jealous of Mozart. I thought this point of view was absolutely astounding. Because although I loved the character of Mozart, I loved even more the character of Salieri.

He is a man obsessed with being the best at music and he has offered God a lot of things in exchange for that. Actually, I really enjoyed his relationship with God. How he thought God communicated with him and sent him messages through other people.

Many people don't like the film because of some historical inaccuracies, but you have to take into account that the character is told through the perspective of someone in a mental hospital. It is told through the point of view of a madman.

I really loved how the film progresses. Every characters begins high up and starts its decent. For Salieri it is his madness. For Mozart, it is his alcoholism. And Mozart's family starts having money problems.

They portray Mozart in such a different way. This movie shows how he is a genius, but he is no gentlemen.

Another thing I really liked is how Mozart thought of music. He heard the music in his head when he was writing it. I thought that was a really nice touch. Specially in a scene in which he starts hearing music when he is talking to his mother in law.

If I had one complaint it would be that it is too long. Im pretty sure that some things could be cut out. The problem is that I don't know what. Everything is amazing.

If you love a good film, you should definitely watch this one.

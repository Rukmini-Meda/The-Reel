The line I posted for the summary title, whether you like it or not, has to be the corniest line in the history of movies. But, I like that line delivered by Liam Neeson as Zeus. I think that's what stood out in the movie other than the CGI.

This movie is a remake of the 1981 original. It's about Perseus who goes on a quest to rid Ancient Greece from the evil of Hades.

I have mixed reactions on the acting. Some were excellent such as Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes who reminded me of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter films. Sam Worthington i think is miscast. He looked like the same guy from Avatar.

This movie is what I call a good popcorn film. There is impressive action and CGI(especially to the kraken). The script and some of the acting is mediocre. But, most people including myself likes that kind of film. I can't wait for the second one in 2012. I rate this movie 8/10.

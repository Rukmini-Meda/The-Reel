For someone who loves writing reviews, of books and movies, every now and then, to be spellbound and speechless after watching a movie says a lot.

Generally, as my experience suggests, you can figure if a movie is good, great or extraordinary within the first 15 minutes, and 'A Beautiful Mind' goes beyond these categories. It is truly a work of genius.

To have friends who always stand by you, to have a family who believes in you, protects you and supports you, the movie in a way brings back the faith in love and relationship.

And to know the entire movie is based on a true story makes it even more special!

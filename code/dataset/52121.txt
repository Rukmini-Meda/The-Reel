Firstly, if Tom Hooper wanted to make the musical more like Victor Hugo's novel, then he should have just adapted the novel. The changes here from the musical work against the movie's favor because they turn the fantastical into the mundane.

Secondly, recording all the songs live on the set is certainly impressive, but as an audience member it felt like it reduced the ability of the songs and the music to convey the emotion of the scene. In a musical, the emotions come from the songs, and when a song is sung in a slobbery whisper the emotions are muted, no matter how well or realistically the actor is crying.

Thirdly, the on-set recording also constricted the camera's ability to capture wide shots. This created a claustrophobic feeling and for a musical with as grand a story as Les Miserables this was a huge problem. It also made each song look and feel the same, which is a real problem for a musical like this where every line of dialogue is sung. It gets tedious very quickly.

Fourthly, I don't think Hugh Jackman can sing the part of Jean Valjean. "Bring Him Home" kind of falls off the mark from every other version I've seen. Acting-wise, sure, but this is a musical and I had a hard time buying him. Plus, that new song "Suddenly" is a bore and was certainly made and inserted solely for a chance at an Oscar.

Fifthly, the stage actors, Aaron Tveit as Enjolras and Samantha Barks as Eponine, are terrific. They carry their songs with confidence and ease. They were a pleasure to watch and listen to. It's a shame their great parts were reduced for the more famous members of the cast.

Lastly, I can't hate this. I love the stage show too much and despite this feeling completely different I still watch it from time to time.

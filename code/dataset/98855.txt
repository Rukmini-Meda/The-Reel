Although we are not in the times where musicals are as popular, Les Miserables is for me and hopefully for others too a musical which deserves to be watched over and over again. Heart gripping story of people's faith,love and desire for freedom. Great mixture of actors some more some less known giving a good balance. You also have a singing Russel Crowe and he isn't bad at all. Although the story line is quite sad, Sasha Baron Cohen brings in his sense of humor making the musical have everything it needs. Everyone will find something for themselves.

AMAZING!!!

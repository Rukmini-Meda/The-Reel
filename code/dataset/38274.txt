 Clash Of The Titans is not as bad as people might tell you it's actually pretty cool it's kinda slow at times but still cool the film stars Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Nicholas Hoult, Ralph Fiennes, Mads Mikkelsen, Gemma Arterton, Alexa Davalos, Izabella Miko, Danny Huston, Jason Flemyng and Polly Walker and it was directed by Louis Leterrier. I think the acting was good not perfect but good. The effects were really great at times and poor at others. The action sequences were pretty epic and overall a fun movie to watch with a lot of action and some good effects definitely better than the rating it has. Loved it!!!!!!

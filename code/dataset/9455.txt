 I must say that I used to think that Cosette was the most Miserable one of "Les Miserables" but when I watched this movie ... Oh man! I cried a lot for Eponine! Especially when she said while dying "You're here. That's all I need to know!". It' probably the saddest scene I've ever scene since the last moments of "The Mist". I liked Samantha Barks more than Amanda Seyfried and I think she acts better as a Miserable. I'm like her too I guess. But beside all that Eponine-stuff this movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. I don't wanna praise it because it's already got a lot of acclaim. I just wanted to say that Eponine is my hero in the movie, not Valjean, but 'Ponine. Thank you Ms. Barks.

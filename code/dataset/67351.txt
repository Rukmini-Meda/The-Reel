 first of all this movie is not for those movie geeks out here who think they are godfather of movie cinema.I mean this is a kind of fantasy disaster flick that has all the charm.I see funny reviews like 2012 wont be a disaster day or so...WELL what is your problem?? No body asked your expert reviews on the evolution and philosophy.If the director feels that Mayans should come,they come.If Africa stays,It stays.As if you idiots can decide the nature and shape of earth .Ya i guess it were you fellows who discovered gravity ,right? I never right reviews but this movie was damn underrated because people are sheep here. I enjoyed the movie and was thrilled until the end .GTFO to those who have extra brains.Go don't waste your time on movies ,you can only like brainless movies like Scott pilgrim. I salute the director's EFFORTS AND conclude it " A MUST WATCH "

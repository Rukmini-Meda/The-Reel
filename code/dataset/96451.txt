I've never been interested in this musical because the idea of turning a novel like Les Miserables into a musical seemed insane, like making a musical based on the Holocaust. But I happened on the fantastic video of Anne Hathaway singing "I Dreamed a Dream" and immediately thought "I've GOT to see this movie!"

As it turns out, I was right before, and that scene is the ONLY thing worth seeing in the whole 2 1/2-hour movie. Some of the music is beautiful, but all of the lyrics are moronic, like something a twelve-year-old might write.

But even if the original French lyrics are much better, this story just does not work set to music. I know the musical was hugely successful, but I still think it's a big mistake. I'm giving Hathaway three stars.

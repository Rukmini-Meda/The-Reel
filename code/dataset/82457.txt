After John Nash, a brilliant but asocial mathematician, accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish. A Beautiful Mind was actually a suggestion that a friend told me too a couple of years back and i have seen it like 2 or 3 times so far and the best thing of this is without a doubt Russell Crowe he is just magnificent in this film he gives a truly inspiring performance as Nash and so does Jennifer Connelly also Ed Harris does a great job in here and the same goes for Paul Bettany if you really haven't seen this please do it's a great dramatic movie about a man that was a pure genius and truly helped this world with his mind and director Ron Howard shows it.

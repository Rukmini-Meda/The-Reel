One word, DREADFUL!! Never have i felt so let down watching a movie, maybe i was just to hyped up so its easy to get disappointed, but no, it was just that poor? The acting was ridiculous, as was almost everything else in the movie.

Cant believe i wasted money and time watching this, one or two good moments where you start to believe things are going to get better, but guess what, they don't.

They could of made this an all time classic with a bit of real effort.

Same as 80% of all remakes, rubbish.

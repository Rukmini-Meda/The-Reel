When I first heard of the movie I thought it would be really interesting. I was excited to see it, but when I finally watched it, the only thing the only good thing I found about it was the effects.

The movie doesn't represent Greek mythology at all. First of all what's with the scorpions? There is no giant scorpions in Greek mythology. It's just Hollywood trying to make it interesting, but to me it just looked plain ridiculous. In the movie the people had completely changed the story to the original plot line. Why is the movie is going on about the gods getting revenge? Instead of showing just basing the movie on hate, why don't you bring some other emotions? Not to say they don't, they are weak and it makes me sad.

The characters in the movie are weak and weird as well. When I heard Sam Worthington was in it I thought, Oh Avatar right? This must be good, but when I saw it. It was almost like he was just a big tough meat head. His costar Gemma Arterton played the role of Io. Like who is that? Now there adding random unnecessary characters? What's the point? The gods in the movie focused on Zeus and Hades. I was disappointed they only other god that got to have *one* line was Ares (I think it was him). I wanted to see a variety of gods and goddess's.

Well, the last thing I got to say is that the effects were amazing and saved the movie from being completely terrible. This is my opinion of the movie and honestly I suppose it isn't that bad, but it could be a billion times better.

All-time favorite movie: Tie between The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather. Alright, now that I have reviewed The Shawshank Redemption, it is time we go through the other greatest thing in cinematic history. That film... is the 1972 motion picture The Godfather. Not a kid- appropriate movie at all when you got a scene of a severed horse head and several brutal deaths but even then it is a masterpiece. FACT. You got one of the greatest casts ever in this masterpiece. Review of the second one coming soon but this is still amazing.

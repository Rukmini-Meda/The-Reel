 Sir Laurence Olivier's film, with Maggie Smith, among other renowned actors, was a film with a script full of magic and fantasy, where the gods participate and have the role that is believed in Ancient Greece. In the new film, it is the same classic Hollywood mistake where the Greeks hate the gods. Perseus hates his father Zeuz, hates all the gods because they punish the men, and from there we go on a bad road. Zeuz can do whatever he wants, he is the creator of everything, therefore, he knows the fate of all men, of all Gods and can control it. I cannot believe that with the special effects we have, we have so bad stories that make the movies do not get that attraction of the viewer. I did not understand because there is no such respect from the original film for the creation of the new, tease the owl, pegasus now comes in black, kraken is a turtle with tentacles, I think the best thing about the movie is Medusa. In short this movie is a disaster.

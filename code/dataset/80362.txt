STAR WARS EPISODE ONE: THE PHANTOM MENACE. cue the John Williams theme music. George Lucas gives us a fantastic look at how the story begins.We meet Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi We see the beginning of the Empire in the way events are manipulated the story unfolds in it's own time nothing is rushed. every thing means something and it blends together beautifully. Liam Neeson is simply the whole movie Darth Maul's evil look might've been a publicist's dream but Qui gon jinn is the heart of the movie and Ewen Macgregor simply wonderful as Kenobi. The movie never earned all the basing it got it's about as wonderful a time as you will ever have reliving your childhood or watching a grand adventure movie. The Phantom menace is one of the best in this genre .

Basically a weird action romp, with terrible acting, and a lot of mumbling on Stallone's part. Another thing that will creep you out is that Stallone is wearing heavy makeup, enough to compete with a porcelain doll. That face is melting.

The only highlights of the movie was Batista's daughter, Batista, Statham, Statham's girlfriend, Jet Li, Lundgren.

But seeing them wasn't enough to balance-out the terror I felt when looking at whatever Stallone has become.

I hope you don't watch this movie. I watched this title because Jackie Chan confirmed that he will be in the third one. Maybe he can save the franchise?

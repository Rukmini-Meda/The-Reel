 This movie was the first musical I ever watched and it made me love the musicals. Cast plays really well although it is not easy to sing and play at the same time. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and the other cast are successful on that. I got the emotions clearly while watching the movie. Of course, Victor Hugo, author of the book, Les Miserables, played an important role in beauty of the movie because the book is one of the best. While I was watching the movie, I remembered the book that I read almost 15 years ago. I perceived the same feelings after 15 years and that made me really happy. The movie tells the virtues of French Revolution in a touchy manner. Vivre la France...

 What was this movie about? This does not even look Greek. More like the famous American formula of destroying many historical and mythological events. This movie was just awful.

Hated among the audiences in my country it was featured as the worst movie selections for you to see.

Despite those awful points the director used his mind and created a new mythological story but for sure don't think that this is Greek mythology. Greek mythology is even better. This movie was bad to be honest but still there are people who don't know history or anything to judge it right.Overrated and really bad

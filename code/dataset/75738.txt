My Personal Rating - 7.8/10 - The Acting is good, the plot is good, the story is at least interesting, the cinematography is decent what a good film. may not be for anyone but i'm telling you know, this film is decently crafted, you should watch this if you love good drama driven about a intelligence man . i'm gonna admit, even i was hooked. this film is worth your time.

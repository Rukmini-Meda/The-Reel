 This movie is simply wonderful, an astonishing movie. As a reader of the original Victor Hugo's novel I found that the movie is a true reproduction of the original one, very touching, impressive . Anne Hathaway as Fantine brought tears in my eyes, extremely afraid after spitting on Jean Valjean , incredible performance and incredible talent. Jean Valjean the innocent prisoner , the one who feel the injustice as he was jailed just because he stole a piece of bread to feed his hunger, also an incredible performance from Hugh Jackman. Finally the unique performance of Russell Crowe, the aggressive stone-hearted Javert, who think he is serving God and justice, with his rigid cruelty look. The movie deserve not only 10 points bit 20 or even 100 points.

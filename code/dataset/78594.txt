Avatar is a science fantasy for the ages, an instant cult-classic that is endearingly beautiful in nearly any way you look at it. It visually raised the bar far, far beyond anything cinema had done prior, introducing the world's audiences to an era of virtual cinematography unparalleled to any other motion-picture period, bar none.

Avatar is a philosophical film that explores the timeless notion of a higher power, and our position as the 'dominant' species. The planet of visitation known only as 'Pandora' parallels our world in many ways, the film grips the viewer and asks, "who's really the alien? Who's really the outsider?" it shows man as an accursed being to any place he might dare to dwell; 'Pandora's box' reflecting the human temptation of the knowledge of life and death in the world, as stated in the Bible. Illustrating the clash between low consciousness (invasion force) and high consciousness (na'vi).

The plot line is simplistic, yet manages to be exemplary. It demonstrates man's often uncanny detachment from the world around him, and predisposition to subduing the earth and making it an extension of his ego, as opposed to something to harmonise with, the saying "wealth but at what cost?" comes to mind.

The plot line follows a paraplegic marine, (Sam Worthington) who is forced to fight between this notion of harmony, and the notion of fractal greed, it turns out that his physical inhibition (paraplegia) is surpassed by joining the 'higher' consciousness through leaving his body, perhaps alluding to how spiritualism is our escape from the prison of flesh we inhabit.

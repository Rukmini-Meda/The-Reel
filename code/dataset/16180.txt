 this film although was interesting it did lack some very important qualities, it is not the 21st of December, and there has been NO APOCALYPSE! i am very disappointed by this and i think that the producers have a lot to answer for, i was looking forwards to today being the day the world ended, but hey ho, the movie was good, it's not the best of movies but i believe that it is a reasonably good movie, i would have rated it higher than 6/10 but i am still slightly disappointed that the producers have lied to us about, what would have been, a most monumental occasion. i am pleased by this movie though, because i am amused by the thought of America being destroyed by a massive volcano eruption, followed closely by the rest of the world.

First of all, if you go into this film expecting anything but a slapstick look at all the old action heroes, well you will severely disappointed.

You have your core group of 6 characters that are the main group (Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture) and then after that, every movie, is more like a game of spot the celebrity.

The highlight of celebrity appearances would by far have to be Chuck Norris, complete with his own background music all that was missing was the tumbleweed blowing across the street!

All 3 films are full of puns, quotes and jokes about some of the past works of the actors.

The first Expendables has too much story and drama and not a lot of action until the end of the film. Expendables 2 was the best out of the trilogy, starts the action straight away and Expendables 3 was probably the worst out of the three.

The third film seemed more like a casting video, with Stallone travelling around and getting new, younger people for his team. I also found some of the scenes, especially with Mel Gibson, didn't need to be in the movie and wasn't necessary to the storyline including his character buying art and walking up the stairs to his house.

All three films are worth at least a watch once; with #2 being the only one I would watch again.

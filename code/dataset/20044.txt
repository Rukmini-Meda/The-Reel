The Godfather is by far one the best films I have I ever seen. It is my favorite movie ever because of various reasons. The cinematography is exceptional. The dark atmosphere provides the viewer with a visual representation of the shadiness of the Corleone family. The directing and editing are beautiful, with scenes like the baptism killings and Michael's killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey showcasing this. The acting performances are fantastic, some of the best I have ever seen. Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone left a mark on me after seeing it. Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Vigoda, and Castellano all portray their characters perfectly. There is not much else that can be said about how fantastic this movie is. It might be the greatest American film in history. If you have not seen The Godfather, watch it now. You are missing out.

After hearing about this movie for almost 7 years, I've finally watched this and think its awesome. It has great visual effects, a fine cast and an amazing soundtrack. I also like this movie better then Titanic. I mean it has some sad scenes in it, but is much more powerful then Titanic. Its also sort of like the animated film Ferngully the Last Rain-forest, but with more action. It also does have an environmental message that we need to protect all the rain- forests. I think the best scene in this movie was the battle sequence between both the Earthlings and the Na'vi and the hero Jake Sully against the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. I also like the flying sequences in the movie when Jake and Neytiri were flying those bird like creatures all over Pandora. In the end after the great big battle between the humans and Na'vi, most humans were exiled from Pandora back to Earth never to return. Some however were allowed to stay cause they respected Pandora's environment. Jake also became a member of the Na'vi society and all's well that ends well. Awesome movie here and I so recommend this to other people who have not seen it. It also reminds me of Star Wars a little and I don't care what James Cameron thinks of The Force Awakens cause that's still my most favorite movie of all time.

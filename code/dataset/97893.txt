My dream is to become a mathematician, just like John Nash.What I admire him most is that he can do secret work of cryptography for the Pentagon. To me it is the world of spies, secrets, and intelligence. This film is like a mystery, we finally find out that everything is just a dream, just a fantasy, I think his life is to a certain degree, very painful, as the fact comes into light. But in the end the conclusion is bright, he fights against his mental illness, and achieves success, he won the Nobel Prize in economy, and his theory has totally changed the world, has deep effect on everyone's life. Truly worthy the Oscar for best film.

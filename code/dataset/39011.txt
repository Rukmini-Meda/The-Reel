I actually really like this movie, but what do i mean by the word like? Is it visuals, or something else? Sometimes of course you want to escape from the reality and this is really good for that. But maybe it's not a good idea to look for the ways to escape from the reality? May be when i think that i like this movie i might be fooling myself? Indeed there is no direct answer to this question, and the answer to this question is a complex function, which might depend on, for example, to whom do i speak to, or when do i do it and so on.

So my point is that this is stupid to escape from your society and in fact to trait your race to become a cave man?? The movie does not show the inner world of the main character and the reasons why does he make a certain decisions. We just, as an audience doesn't provided with that information.

All of the things in this movie are incredible, very deep and make a lot of sense, in fact, the most sense for a sci fi movie, than any other, But except of course for the very very general one.

So may this be a some kind of the balance to not make a movie just too perfect??

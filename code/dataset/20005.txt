A Beautiful Mind (2001)

Inspired by a bestselling biographical novel by Sylvia Nasar, the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' is based upon the life of Dr. John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel Laureate in Economics.

Starting from his very first day as student in Princeton University, the film shows various aspects of Nash's life, his work at Princeton and MIT and with The Pentagon. He was the kind of person who dedicates his time to mathematics rather than interacting with his fellow student. He was under pressure to find an "Original idea" for his thesis. He got the idea when he and his co-students were discussing on various ways to approach a group of girls. At first the movie seems to be one having more technical things than a story. When half of the movie gets over, Nash's life suddenly took a turn for the worse. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The rest of the movie shows Nash's transformation from a person struggling with schizophrenia who is not able to identify what is true to one of the most significant contributor in Economics. The movie ends as Nash receives Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work in game theory.

I really enjoyed the movie. This movie is a masterpiece and truly worthy of the Oscar which it won in 2002.

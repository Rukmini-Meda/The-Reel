Wow, just wow. I didn't expect much coming into this movie, though I am an avid lover of musicals. The French Revolution just didn't appeal that much to me, but two hours later when the credits were rolling down the screen and tears were rolling down my face, I realized how wrong I was.

Les Miserables is a movie based off a musical based off a book, and there's a reason this story has so many adaptations. It's a romantic tale with many thoroughly developed characters and story lines all woven together with music. Oh man, I've listened to the soundtrack a countless number of times already.

The actors are perfect in their imperfections. Since the songs were sung while filming rather than lip-syncing, they are able to convey more emotion, and emotion certainly is the one word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" is especially heart-wrenching and gave Hathaway a deserved Oscar.

Just--it's good. It's really good. If you enjoy musicals or historical movies, you'll probably love this as much as I do. 9/10. Great stuff.

THIS is how one makes a soulless action movie: by taking a cast of likable and somewhat cliched group of characters who are in to Creedence Clearwater Revival and put them through increasingly unforgiving gunfights.

But the Expendables isn't soulless. There are some moments that you can see the weight of the characters' pasts when they talk about some of the horrible sheit they've been through. There's a very subtle love interest for Stallone's character, Barney Ross, which never kisses him, fawns over him, or tries to sleep with him. The most they share is a hug at the very end.

All of the action celebrities are more or less playing culminations of their various roles in the past, none of which have believable names. But, to be honest, you probably won't care about their names because there is WAY too much crap trying to kill them for you to care.

This is probably the most '80s action movie I've ever seen. It makes the action scenes bigger and bigger and the characters more and more cliched until you have one giant testosterone-fueled explosion of one-liners and, um, explosions.

Seriously, it's awesome.

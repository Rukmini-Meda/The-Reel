This movie was more than just any other movie to me. It had amazing graphics with a beautiful planet an a huge story to it. As I was watching it I just could picture myself in the scenario. And after I watched it one night, I woke up the next morning thinking "why is everything so dull now?". I had just wished something like the world that is in the movie Avatar could be something in real life. Because i wake up every day after watching it thinking "I wish I could be a part of that world.I wish it were real." It gives me a great feeling, and every time I watch it I get goosebumps and chills. It is the best movie I have ever watched.

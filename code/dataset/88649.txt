A typical Roland Emmerich movie - I expect his next oeuvre will feature special effects only and dispense with characters, story line and actors altogether. They certainly were undetectable in this one! Dumb and dumber was a celebration of wit and character development compared with this tripe. It seems that computer technology is sufficient for producing a blockbuster nowadays - I'm sure it made many millions.

No spoiler alert as the "plot"line and photos tell the whole story. What on earth were John Cusack and Woody Harrelson thinking? Bet they look back on this one cringing furiously...

I remember watching the original "Titanic" and "Poseidon Adventure" a long time ago and they both seem like in-depth documentaries in comparison - and that's saying a lot! LOL

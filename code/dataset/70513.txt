 Frankly, I am miffed by the negative reviews for this movie from movie critics who are so far removed from reality and the tastes of real people that any good review they write is more often than not the result of good luck. I am even more miffed by the people who took them seriously, and decided to let them influence their opinion of the movie. The Expendables is a movie with good dialouge, great acting, great action, and an interesting storyline. No, it does not deserve 10/10 (more like 8 or 8.5/10), but my exaggeration is based on the fact that the stars are so fantastic, that just them being all together raises the movie beyond its basic merits.

Connor Macgregor Reviews...Clash Of The Titans

Right OK so i really wasn't thrilled to see this because i just wasn't bothered really,i had other things to occupy myself with.But i eventually got bored and decided to go see Clash Of The Titans and well...it was better than i had expected.

Now the opening was one of the worst ever.I was bored as much as when i went to see "Disaster Movie". Only the film managed to pick up paste and get into a comfortable swing.The plot moved in a steady paste and it got somewhat exciting although not too exciting.Some of the acting was wooden including Sam Worthington.He just didn't try hard.He just threw on a skirt and kept saying "I'm A MAN".The other characters were just extra parts to keep the flow going i guess.

The CGI effects weren't that brilliant.We had seen it all before and this film just had CGI sequence after CGI sequence after CGI sequence.It got old although i will say that the final scene with the Kraken was quite cool.Also i couldn't help but crack up whenever "Argos" was mentioned.If you don't like in The United Kingdom then you might not get it,but i couldn't keep a straight face when "Argos" was mentioned.

Overall this film was littered with CGI sequences but was somewhat enjoyable in cases.Star of the film would have to be the person playing the skull creature thing riding the scorpions,he was cool.

So I watched this movie more than ten times. I never felt enough and somehow I always end up crying.

Now seriously Milos Forman did an amazing job. It keeps impressing me when Salieri takes original sheets how we see the projection of what he sees and of what's written on the paper. How on paper it looks so ordinary, but what we see and what we hear doesn't match. First a gentile sound of flute, just a few notes, nothing else, and then violin interferes... But then, suddenly Salieri turns the page. Now it's a whole new piece,the music changed into to a much more vibrant tempo, it's a whole new story now, and with the music changes the atmosphere.

Also, the story's beautiful. The way that Saliery envies Mozart and desires something that he has, how he turned his back on him, how he fought with God for giving Mozart the talent and giving him for reward only the ability to recognize it.

The hardest part for me is when Mozart dies. In the background you can hear his Requiem, La Crimosa at that time. And instead of Salieri's expectations of his funeral- a big cathedral, music playing, many people, we see how he's thrown into a hole with the rest of poor people who didn't have money to afford a decent funeral. It makes you ask yourself: Doesn't he deserve more? Now we don't even have a stone to call his grave, we know there was no difference of the final resting place of one of a kind music genius and any ordinary man who made no difference in this world. But we still have his music.

Tom Hulce and F.Murrey Abraham acted wonderfully, the movie became so real that it touched me even more with every passing minute. Lines are fantastic too, true, straight, touching, you can apply them on your real life.

One of the best movies I've ever watched.

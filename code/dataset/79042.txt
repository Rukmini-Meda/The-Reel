The American science fiction movie Avatar is one of the classic that you need to watch one time in your life. For a 2009 movie, it was a big thing to create a fascinating world who can interest so many people. Many elements are unique in James Cameron's creation: new high-technology, imaginary creatures, the Na'vi people and the insusceptible environment's decor.

When I first saw it, because I saw it many times, I was thinking that no other movie has impress me this much and that it was a precious art piece. On the other hand, I am not sure that the first is going to stay my favorite. Did you heard that they will be a second part? I was so excited when I learned it! But I was also thinking that the first impression that I get of this movie was unforgettable. This was a brilliant idea who made other movie's director jealous!

You are going to be surprise by every scene if you take the time to watch it, because it is out of the comfortable zone of traditional science fiction movies. I recommend it to everyone who is just a little bit interested by the imaginary of the future.

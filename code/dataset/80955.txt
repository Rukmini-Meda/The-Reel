Worst of the trilogy. In fact I wouldn't call this a Matrix movie, but it was decent. The action was great and over the top, the story was strong. But where's the slow motion, bullet dodging like in the previous two? It isn't there!! The only slow motion parts are in the final battle, which captures the face reacting to the punches.

It was a great conclusion yes, but it isn't The Matrix. This movie should have been called 'The War of the Machines'. The first one is and always will be the best one of the trilogy. I found that this one lacked the class the first two had, not to mention this one was rushed. We waited ONLY six months for this to be released.

The action like I said was good, the effects were good for its time and the script was well written, the acting is superb and the final battle was a great way to end it. Sadly this didn't live up to expectations and it could have been so much more!

6/10

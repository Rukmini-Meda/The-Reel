The movie is supposed to be the life of Nash. It is not. It is a sanitized air brushed fallacy. Part of a beautiful mind is a mind that cares about others, doesn't abandon women he impregnates of a "lower class", doesn't get arrested in bath house raids for public indecency and of course no mention of the long divorce. Not so beautiful a mind. A beautiful snowjob.

The acting is good, and the production excellent, but I harbor a particular contempt for movies that lie about real historical people. But it did make some 170,000,000 dollars. Hollywood just lies and lies and lies. It's a cultural narcotic.

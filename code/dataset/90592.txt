If you ask me "What is the best movie you have ever seen?" (and I was reluctant to say ...The Matrix!) I would probably call "Amadeus" as one of the best i've seen and one of the best movies of all time.

The fact that it won 8 Oscars is an indication for the quality you can expect.

Best picture, screenplay, direction, costumes, some of the best music ever composed, marvelous performances.... A true masterpiece.

The story follows the apocryphal legend that Antonio Salieri was responsible for the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart out of jealousy over the latter's music. (As far as I know, even the descendants of Mozart are considering this as fiction.)

There is no excuse not to see this movie. Even if you think that classical music isn't your thing or you don't care about an 18th century drama, the movie is so emotional and at the same time enjoyable and entertaining that it will win your heart and soul.

The movie has so many memorable scenes that if you own a hard copy, you might find yourself watch them again and again.

Overall: One of the best movies ever made, and it has the awards to prove it.

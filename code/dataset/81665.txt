When I saw this film I was amazed in so many ways the storyline the special effects the characters there isn't much I can fault about this film. There is little I can say that hasn't been said already.

Its one of my favourite films of all time! I watched it and re watched it so many times I have lost count it just never gets old for me. The thought, the planning the detail, so much of this film inspires me to the belief there must be life on other worlds.

I like the concept that humans manage to interact with an alien race through the use of Avatars if the film were real how much R&D would be required to genetically engineer such a human / alien combination and for some of the machines just amazing.
